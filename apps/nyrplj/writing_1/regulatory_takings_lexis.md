Can you do a deep dive on regulatory takings in the context of new york and federal law?

AI Assistant:
Regulatory takings law, both under federal and New York law, addresses situations where government regulations limit the use of private property to such an extent that it effectively constitutes a "taking" under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution or Article I, Section 7 of the New York Constitution. Below is a detailed analysis of the legal framework governing regulatory takings in these jurisdictions.




FEDERAL LAW ON REGULATORY TAKINGS



Under federal law, regulatory takings are governed by the Fifth Amendment, which prohibits the taking of private property for public use without just compensation. The U.S. Supreme Court has identified two primary categories of regulatory takings:

 1. Per Se Takings: These occur in two specific scenarios:
     * When a regulation results in a permanent physical invasion of property, no matter how minor (e.g., Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419) Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc., 544 U.S. 528
       
       "Our precedents stake out two categories of regulatory action that generally will be deemed per se takings for Fifth Amendment purposes. First, where government requires an owner to suffer a permanent physical invasion of her property -- however minor -- it must provide just compensation. See Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419, 73 L. Ed. 2d 868, 102 S. Ct. 3164 (1982) (state law requiring landlords to permit cable companies to install cable facilities in apartment buildings effected a taking). A second categorical rule applies to regulations that completely deprive an owner of "all economically beneficial us[e]" of her property. Lucas, 505 U.S., at 1019, 120 L. Ed. 2d 798, 112 S. Ct. 2886 (emphasis in original). We held in Lucas that the government must pay just compensation for such "total regulatory takings," except to the extent that "background principles of nuisance and property law" independently restrict the owner's intended use of the property. 505 U.S., ..." Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc., 544 U.S. 528, 538.
       
       .
     * When a regulation deprives a property owner of all economically beneficial use of their property, unless the restriction is grounded in "background principles of nuisance and property law" (Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003) Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc., 544 U.S. 528, 1256 Hertel Ave. Assocs., LLC v. Calloway, 761 F.3d 252

       "The Supreme Court has recognized two branches of Takings Clause cases: physical takings and regulatory takings. See Tahoe-Sierra Pres. Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Reg'l Planning Agency, 535 U.S. 302, 322, 122 S. Ct. 1465, 152 L. Ed. 2d 517 (2002). A physical taking occurs when there is either a condemnation or a physical appropriation of property. Id. A regulatory taking, by contrast, occurs where even absent a direct physical appropriation, governmental regulation of private property "goes too far" and is "tantamount to a direct appropriation or ouster." Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc.., 544 U.S. 528, 537, 125 S. Ct. 2074, 161 L. Ed. 2d 876 (2005) (quoting Pa. Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393, 415, 43 S. Ct. 158, 67 L. Ed. 322 (1922) (Holmes, J.)). Because application of the 2005 Amendment to pre-existing liens "does not present the 'classi[c] taking' in which the government directly appropriates private property for its own use," E. Enters. v.

       .
       

 2. Ad Hoc Regulatory Takings: For cases that do not fall into the per se categories, courts apply the multi-factor balancing test established in Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104. The factors include:
     * The economic impact of the regulation on the claimant.
     * The extent to which the regulation interferes with distinct investment-backed expectations.
     * The character of the governmental action, such as whether it involves a physical invasion or merely adjusts economic benefits and burdens for the public good Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc., 544 U.S. 528, 1256 Hertel Ave. Assocs., LLC v. Calloway, 761 F.3d 252, Horne v. Dep't of Agric., 576 U.S. 351

NEW YORK LAW ON REGULATORY TAKINGS



New York law aligns closely with federal principles but incorporates additional considerations under its Constitution and statutory framework. Article I, Section 7 of the New York Constitution mirrors the Fifth Amendment, prohibiting the taking of private property without just compensation NY CLS Const Art I, § 7

"(a) Private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation. (b) [Repealed] (c) Private roads may be opened in the manner to be prescribed by law; but in every case the necessity of the road and the amount of all damage to be sustained by the opening thereof shall be first determined by a jury of freeholders, and such amount, together with the expenses of the proceedings, shall be paid by the person to be benefited. ..."NY CLS Const Art I, § 7

. The New York Eminent Domain Procedure Law (EDPL) provides the exclusive mechanism for acquiring property through eminent domain and ensures just compensation for takings NY CLS EDPL § 101

"It is the purpose of this law to provide the exclusive procedure by which property shall be acquired by exercise of the power of eminent domain in New York state; to assure that just compensation shall be paid to those persons whose property rights are acquired by the exercise of the power of eminent domain; to establish opportunity for public participation in the planning of public projects necessitating the exercise of eminent domain; to give due regard to the need to acquire property for public use as well as the legitimate interests of private property owners, local communities and the quality of the environment, and to that end to promote and facilitate recognition and careful consideration of those interests; to encourage settlement of claims for just compensation and expedite payments to property owners; to establish rules to reduce litigation, and to ensure equal treatment to all property owners. ..."NY CLS EDPL § 101

KEY PRINCIPLES IN NEW YORK REGULATORY TAKINGS JURISPRUDENCE


 1. Heavy Burden of Proof: New York courts impose a "heavy burden" on property owners challenging regulations as takings. The claimant must overcome the presumption of constitutionality attached to the regulation and demonstrate that the economic value of the property has been destroyed, leaving only a "bare residue" of value (Matter of Gazza v. New York State Dep't of Envtl. Conservation, 89 N.Y.2d 603) Matter of Master Built Homes II Corp. v. New York City Dept. of Bldgs., 220 A.D.3d 867, Briarcliff Assocs. v. Town of Cortlandt, 272 A.D.2d 488
    
    "The Supreme Court also properly rejected the petitioners' contention that the Department of Parks' demand for restitution violates the Takings Clauses of the United States Constitution and the New York State Constitution. There is a "heavy burden placed upon one alleging a regulatory taking" ( Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v DeBenedictis, 480 U.S. 470, 493 [1987]). "If the contested regulation falls short of eliminating all economically viable uses of the encumbered property, the Court looks to several factors to determine whether a taking occurred, including 'the regulation's economic effect on the landowner, the extent to which the regulation interferes with reasonable investment-backed expectations, and the character of the government action'" ( Matter of Smith v Town of Mendon, 4 NY3d 1, 9, 822 N.E.2d 1214, 789 N.Y.S.2d 696 [2004], quoting Palazzolo v Rhode Island, 533 U.S. 606, 617, 121 S. Ct. 2448, 150 L. Ed. 2d 592 [2001]; see Penn Central Transp. Co. v New York City, 438 U. ..." Matter of Master Built Homes II Corp. v. New York City Dept. of Bldgs., 220 A.D.3d 867, 873.
    
    "As the Court of Appeals has stated, "[ a] landowner who claims that land regulation has effected a taking of his property bears the heavy burden of overcoming the presumption of constitutionality that attaches to the regulation and proving every element of his claim beyond a reasonable doubt" (de St. Aubin v Flacke, 68 NY2d 66, 76 [emphasis supplied]; see also, Matter of Wedinger v Goldberger, 71 NY2d 428, 439-440, cert denied 488 US 850).
    In this context, the Court of Appeals has observed that, " [o]nly when the evidence shows that the economic value, or all but a bare residue of the value, of the parcel has been destroyed has a 'taking' been established" ( Spears v Berle, 48 NY2d 254, 263). Moreover, "it is clear that the 'mere diminution in the value of property, however serious, is insufficient to demonstrate a taking' … Furthermore … the fact that a regulation 'deprives the property of its most beneficial use does not render it unconstitutional' ( Goldblatt v Hempstead, 369 US ..." Briarcliff Assocs. v. Town of Cortlandt, 272 A.D.2d 488, 490.
    
    .
    
 2. Per Se and Ad Hoc Takings: New York courts apply the same distinction between per se takings and ad hoc regulatory takings as federal courts. For per se takings, the regulation must result in a total deprivation of economically viable use (Lucas, 505 U.S. 1003) Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc., 544 U.S. 528, Friedenburg v. N.Y. State Dep't of Envtl. Conservation, 3 A.D.3d 86
    
    "Our precedents stake out two categories of regulatory action that generally will be deemed per se takings for Fifth Amendment purposes. First, where government requires an owner to suffer a permanent physical invasion of her property -- however minor -- it must provide just compensation. See Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419, 73 L. Ed. 2d 868, 102 S. Ct. 3164 (1982) (state law requiring landlords to permit cable companies to install cable facilities in apartment buildings effected a taking). A second categorical rule applies to regulations that completely deprive an owner of "all economically beneficial us[e]" of her property. Lucas, 505 U.S., at 1019, 120 L. Ed. 2d 798, 112 S. Ct. 2886 (emphasis in original). We held in Lucas that the government must pay just compensation for such "total regulatory takings," except to the extent that "background principles of nuisance and property law" independently restrict the owner's intended use of the property. 505 U.S., ..." Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc., 544 U.S. 528, 538.
    
    "Thus, an analysis of a regulatory taking spans both ends of a spectrum. At one end is a regulation that merely diminishes the value of the land requiring no compensation. At the other extreme is the regulation that results in a total deprivation in value, tantamount to a physical taking demanding just compensation (see Lucas v South Carolina Coastal Council, supra). In the instant case, it is conceded that the petitioners' property retains at least a 5% residuary value. In light of Tahoe-Sierra, a categorical or per se rule on a regulatory taking as applied in Lucas is not applicable here. Accordingly, we hold that the DEC's denial of a permit for a single family dwelling does not constitute a categorical or per se taking of the petitioners' property. VI Notwithstanding that the petitioners have not established a per se taking, they have demonstrated a taking using the balancing test of Penn Cent. Transp. Co. v City of New York, 438 U.S. 104, 57 L. Ed. 2d 631, 98 S. Ct. 2646 [1978]), a ..." Friedenburg v. N.Y. State Dep't of Envtl. Conservation, 3 A.D.3d 86, 95.
    
    . For ad hoc takings, courts use the Penn Central factors to evaluate the economic impact, interference with investment-backed expectations, and the character of the government action (Penn Central, 438 U.S. 104) Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc., 544 U.S. 528, Matter of Master Built Homes II Corp. v. New York City Dept. of Bldgs., 220 A.D.3d 867, Friedenburg v. N.Y. State Dep't of Envtl. Conservation, 3 A.D.3d 86

 3. Economic Viability and Reasonable Return: To establish a regulatory taking, the claimant must provide "dollars and cents" evidence showing that the regulation prevents the property from producing a reasonable return. Mere diminution in property value is insufficient (de St. Aubin v. Flacke, 68 N.Y.2d 66) Matter of Master Built Homes II Corp. v. New York City Dept. of Bldgs., 220 A.D.3d 867, Briarcliff Assocs. v.

Briarcliff Assocs. v. Town of Cortlandt, 272 A.D.2d 488, 490.
    
    .
    
 4. Public Burdens and Fairness: A regulation may constitute a taking if it imposes an "onerous burden" on property owners that should, in fairness, be borne by the public as a whole (Armstrong v. United States, 364 U.S. 40) Briarcliff Assocs. v. Town of Cortlandt, 272 A.D.2d 488

PROCEDURAL CONSIDERATIONS IN NEW YORK



New York provides two primary avenues for seeking compensation for regulatory takings:
 1. Filing a claim under the EDPL NY CLS EDPL § 101
    
    "It is the purpose of this law to provide the exclusive procedure by which property shall be acquired by exercise of the power of eminent domain in New York state; to assure that just compensation shall be paid to those persons whose property rights are acquired by the exercise of the power of eminent domain; to establish opportunity for public participation in the planning of public projects necessitating the exercise of eminent domain; to give due regard to the need to acquire property for public use as well as the legitimate interests of private property owners, local communities and the quality of the environment, and to that end to promote and facilitate recognition and careful consideration of those interests; to encourage settlement of claims for just compensation and expedite payments to property owners; to establish rules to reduce litigation, and to ensure equal treatment to all property owners. ..."NY CLS EDPL § 101
    
    .
 2. Pursuing a claim under Article I, Section 7 of the New York Constitution NY CLS Const Art I, § 7, Seventh Regiment Fund v. Pataki, 179 F. Supp. 2d 356, Allocco Recycling, Ltd. v. Doherty, 378 F. Supp. 2d 348
    
    "(a) Private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation. (b) [Repealed] (c) Private roads may be opened in the manner to be prescribed by law; but in every case the necessity of the road and the amount of all damage to be sustained by the opening thereof shall be first determined by a jury of freeholders, and such amount, together with the expenses of the proceedings, shall be paid by the person to be benefited. ..."NY CLS Const Art I, § 7

    "A federal court, moreover, cannot entertain a takings claims under § 1983 unless or until the complaining landowner has been denied an adequate postdeprivation remedy." City of Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, 721, 143 L. Ed. 2d 882, 119 S. Ct. 1624 (1999). See also HBP Associates, 893 F. Supp. at 277 ("To fulfill the . . . requirement that the taking be 'without just compensation,' [plaintiff] must allege that it exhausted state procedures for obtaining just compensation."). Plaintiffs' failure to pursue remedies under state law precludes the assertion of a takings claim at this juncture. See, e.g., West 95 Hous. Corp., 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7784, 2001 WL 664628, at 6. Defendants contend, and Plaintiffs do not dispute, that New York state provides a remedy under its eminent domain procedures if Plaintiffs have a property interest in the Armory. (State Defts.' Reply Mem. at 10, citing N.Y. Eminent Domain Proced. Law §§ 101, 201, 301.) See New Holl ..." Seventh Regiment Fund v. Pataki, 179 F. Supp. 2d 356, 362.
    
    "Plaintiff concedes that it has not sought compensation prior to this suit, but responds in its brief, without any support, that New York has no mechanism for obtaining compensation for a regulatory taking. This naked allegation is found nowhere in the complaint and is wrong as a matter of law. Well-settled law in this Circuit establishes that New York does provide adequate means for obtaining compensation for a regulatory taking. See, e.g., RKO Del., Inc. v. City of New York, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17644, No. CV 002592 (DGT), 2001 WL 1329060, at 5 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 30, 2001); Goldfine v. Kelly, 80 F. Supp. 2d 153, 161 (S.D.N.Y. 2000); Gottlieb v. Vill. of Irvington, 69 F. Supp. 2d 553, 560 (S.D.N.Y. 1999); Deepwells Estates, Inc. v. Inc. Vill. of Head of Harbor, 973 F. Supp. 338, 348 (E.D.N.Y. 1997); Rivervale Realty Co. v. Town of Orangetown, 816 F. Supp. 937, 943 (S.D.N.Y. 1993); Sudarsky v. City of New York, 779 F. Supp. 287, 301 (S.D.N.Y. 1991).

Historically, federal courts required plaintiffs to exhaust state remedies before bringing a takings claim under 42 USCS § 1983 (Williamson County Regional Planning Commission v. Hamilton Bank, 473 U.S. 172). However, the U.S. Supreme Court in Knick v. Township of Scott, 139 S. Ct. 2162, overruled this requirement, allowing property owners to bring takings claims directly in federal court without first seeking state remedies Billeris v. Inc. Vill. of Bayville, 694 F. Supp. 3d 214

"In October 2013, before filing this lawsuit, Plaintiff filed a lawsuit against the Village, the Board of Appeals, and the Village's building inspector in New York Supreme Court, Nassau County, asserting claims under Article 78 of New York's Civil Practice Law and Rules. ECF No. 1 ¶ 47. At that time, the law required her to do so because the U.S. Supreme Court had held that a plaintiff could not assert a takings claim in federal court under Section 1983 without first satisfying two requirements. Williamson Cty. Reg'l Plan. Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U.S. 172, 186, 195, 105 S. Ct. 3108, 87 L. Ed. 2d 126 (1985). The first requirement prohibited a plaintiff from challenging land use regulations in federal court without first receiving from the government entity that imposed the regulations "a final decision regarding the application of the regulations to the property at issue." Id. at 186. The second requirement was that a plaintiff had to pursue any "adequate proced ..." Billeris v. Inc. Vill. of Bayville, 694 F. Supp. 3d 214, 222.

CONCLUSION



Both federal and New York law recognize regulatory takings as a complex area requiring careful balancing of private property rights and public interests. While federal law provides the foundational framework through the Penn Central test and per se rules, New York law imposes additional evidentiary and procedural requirements, emphasizing the need for claimants to demonstrate substantial economic harm and pursue state remedies where applicable. These principles collectively ensure that property owners are protected against excessive regulatory burdens while allowing governments to regulate for the public good.
