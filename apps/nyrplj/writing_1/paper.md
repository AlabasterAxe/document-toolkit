"You can't lose!" my grandfather explained. I sat across from him in my grandparents' 500 square foot, 1-bedroom apartment. He was telling me about the wonders of real estate investment trusts (REITs). REITs are an investment where a large company holds real property and allows retail investors to own a small piece of their property portfolio. It being 2007, my grandfather's confidence in REITs was admittedly misplaced,{{ENDNOTE:The 2008 financial crisis saw REIT returns decline significantly. See PLACEHOLDER - REIT performance data 2007-2008.}} but the larger point is that REITs offered him a way to invest in real estate, despite not owning a home.

As of July 1st, 2025, the NY legislature has curtailed access to single- and two-family homes for large institutional investors (like the ones that offered my grandfather's REITs).{{ENDNOTE:N.Y. Real Prop. Law § 521 (McKinney 2025).}} NY RPL § 521 provides that institutional investors are subject to a 90-day waiting period before they are allowed to put in an offer on single- and two-family homes.{{ENDNOTE:Id. § 521(2).}} While at first glance, this seems like a common-sense technique to give individual home buyers a brief head start, the details of the statute and the reality of New York's housing market suggest that the impact might be more dramatic. The median house in New York State is only on the market between 25 and 50 days, and the 90-day waiting period resets after any price change, meaning this could be a de facto prohibition rather than a mere delay.

This restriction on institutional investors raises a fundamental constitutional question: when does government regulation of property markets cross the line from permissible police power into a compensable regulatory taking? The doctrine of regulatory takings provides the framework for evaluating whether such restrictions, however well-intentioned, exceed the government's authority to regulate private property without compensation. This analysis matters not only for the institutional investors directly affected, but for the ordinary Americans whose investment vehicles' stand to be negatively impacted by these changes.

## I. Background

### A. Federal Regulatory Takings

The Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause provides that private property shall not "be taken for public use, without just compensation."{{ENDNOTE:U.S. Const. amend. V.}} This protection extends beyond physical seizures to regulatory actions that effectively deprive property owners of economically viable use of their land.{{ENDNOTE:See Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393 (1922) (establishing that regulations can constitute takings).}} The Supreme Court has developed two primary categories of regulatory takings analysis: per se takings and ad hoc takings under the *Penn Central* test.{{ENDNOTE:See Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc., 544 U.S. 528, 538 (2005) (describing the categorical framework for regulatory takings).}}

Per se takings occur in two scenarios: permanent physical invasion of property{{ENDNOTE:Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419 (1982).}} or regulations that deprive property of "all economically beneficial use".{{ENDNOTE:Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003 (1992).}} If the case does not fall into one of those established categories, courts apply the multi-factor balancing test established in *Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City* (1978), which considers: (1) the economic impact of the regulation, (2) the extent to which the regulation interferes with investment-backed expectations, and (3) the character of the governmental action.{{ENDNOTE:Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104 (1978); Id. at 124.}}

### B. Regulatory Takings in New York State

Article I, § 7 of the New York Constitution mirrors federal takings protections{{ENDNOTE:N.Y. Const. art. I, § 7(a) ("Private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation.").}} but has been interpreted by New York courts to impose a "heavy burden" on property owners challenging regulations.{{ENDNOTE:PLACEHOLDER - NY state court precedent establishing heavy burden standard.}} Under *Matter of Gazza v. NY State Department of Environmental Conservation*, claimants must demonstrate that regulation destroyed "all but a bare residue" of their property's value.{{ENDNOTE:Matter of Gazza v. N.Y. State Dep't of Env't Conservation, 89 N.Y.2d 603, 608 (1997).}}

### C. Temporary Takings

The United States Supreme Court's decision in *First English Evangelical Lutheran Church v. County of Los Angeles* (1987) established that temporary takings, like permanent ones, require compensation.{{ENDNOTE:First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U.S. 304, 318 (1987).}} However, *Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency* (2002) clarified that development moratoriums are generally not per se takings, requiring case-by-case analysis under *Penn Central*.{{ENDNOTE:Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 535 U.S. 302, 321 (2002).}} The duration and purpose of temporal restrictions remain crucial factors in determining whether compensation is required.{{ENDNOTE:Id. at 342 (noting that context and duration are "defining characteristics" of regulatory takings analysis).}}

## II. Overview of NY Real Property Law § 521

New York Real Property Law § 521 introduces a mandatory 90-day waiting period for "covered entities" seeking to purchase single- or two-family residential properties.{{ENDNOTE:N.Y. Real Prop. Law § 521(1) (McKinney 2025).}} The statute includes several key provisions:

1. **Waiting Period Mechanism**: Covered entities cannot make offers on covered properties for 90 days following the property's initial listing for sale.{{ENDNOTE:Id. § 521(2)(a).}}

2. **Price Change Restart**: If the seller changes the asking price, a new 90-day period begins, potentially extending the exclusion period indefinitely through strategic pricing adjustments.{{ENDNOTE:Id. § 521(2)(b).}}

3. **Enforcement Provisions**: Violations carry civil penalties up to $250,000, with disclosure requirements for covered entities and mandatory posting of waiting period information.{{ENDNOTE:Id. § 521(5)(a); Id. § 521(3); Id. § 521(4).}}

The statute defines covered entities by reference to RPL § 520, encompassing institutional investors, investment funds, and certain corporate entities with substantial assets.{{ENDNOTE:N.Y. Real Prop. Law § 521(1) (referencing § 520 definition) (McKinney 2025); N.Y. Real Prop. Law § 520 (McKinney 2025) (defining covered entities).}} This definition aims to distinguish between individual homebuyers and large-scale institutional investors while avoiding over-broad application to smaller investment entities or family limited partnerships.{{ENDNOTE:PLACEHOLDER - Legislative intent or committee report citation.}}

The legislative record reveals three primary policy goals: (1) protecting individual homebuyers from institutional investor competition in tight housing markets, (2) addressing housing affordability concerns by reducing speculative investment, and (3) preventing corporate consolidation of single-family housing stock that could reduce homeownership opportunities for working families.{{ENDNOTE:PLACEHOLDER - Legislative record/committee report citation; PLACEHOLDER - Legislative findings on housing affordability impact; PLACEHOLDER - Legislative findings on homeownership impact.}}

## III. Application: Two Possible Theories

Under existing regulatory takings doctrines, there are two possible arguments that institutional investors could make, both of which face significant hurdles. The first argument is that the 90-day delay operates as a temporary taking wherein the delay operates as a complete preclusion from using their property for 90 days. The second is that this statute constitutes a taking of the interest in the real property investments which are contingent upon their access to the inventory of one- and two-family homes.

### A. Temporary Taking Analysis

The 90-day waiting period raises questions about temporary regulatory takings under *First English*. However, two important factors distinguish RPL § 521 from the development moratorium at issue in that case. First, unlike the comprehensive development moratoriums that lasted 32 months in *Tahoe-Sierra*, RPL § 521 contemplates only a 90-day delay, which courts are likely to view as falling within the range of normal regulatory delays rather than extraordinary restrictions requiring compensation. Second, and more significantly, the institutional investors affected by the statute do not yet own the properties subject to the waiting period, making it difficult to argue that they have been deprived of the use of property they do not possess.

Courts applying *Tahoe-Sierra's* framework would likely examine whether the 90-day period, in the context of typical real estate transaction timelines, constitutes a meaningful deprivation of property rights or merely a reasonable regulatory delay. Given that the restriction operates on market access rather than property use, and affects competitive timing rather than ownership rights, a court would likely not be receptive to an argument that this constitutes an uncompensated temporary taking.

### B. Investment-Backed Expectations

#### 1. Economic Impact

The economic impact becomes clear when examining actual market conditions. In New York State, the median days on market was 29 days in August 2025, with a range of 26-50 days over the previous two years.{{ENDNOTE:Redfin, New York State Housing Market Data (Aug. 2025), https://www.redfin.com/state/New-York/housing-market.}} This means the 90-day waiting period effectively excludes institutional investors from the vast majority of property sales, as most homes sell well before the waiting period expires. 

For institutional investors whose business models depend on rapid property acquisition—such as house-flipping operations or rental portfolio expansion—the statute creates measurable competitive disadvantages. The economic impact is compounded by the price-change restart provision, which allows sellers to potentially extend the waiting period indefinitely.

#### 2. Investment-Backed Expectations

Institutional investors argue they have reasonable investment-backed expectations in their ability to compete equally in residential property markets. They point to established business relationships, capital commitments to acquisition strategies, and regulatory frameworks that previously treated all qualified buyers equally.

However, the real estate market has long been subject to various regulatory restrictions, including zoning laws, rent control, and environmental regulations. Courts have generally held that investors enter regulated markets with notice of potential future restrictions. The question becomes whether RPL § 521 represents a fundamental change in regulatory approach or a reasonable extension of existing market regulation.

#### 3. Character of Government Action

RPL § 521 represents regulatory action rather than physical appropriation. The burden is distributed across a class of institutional investors rather than targeting specific entities. The statute serves the legitimate public purpose of promoting housing affordability and homeownership opportunities.

Significantly, the law does not transfer property from institutional investors to individual buyers—it merely adjusts the timing of market competition. This temporal shifting of competitive advantage differs from regulations that permanently exclude certain parties from market participation.

#### 4. *Gazza*'s "Bare Residue" Standard

Under New York State law, regulatory takings claims face the additional hurdle of the "bare residue" test established in *Matter of Gazza v. NY State Department of Environmental Conservation*. This standard requires plaintiffs to demonstrate that regulation destroyed "all but a bare residue" of their property's value. For institutional investors challenging RPL § 521, this standard would present a formidable obstacle.

Most institutional investors operate diversified portfolios that extend well beyond New York's single- and two-family home market. A nationwide real estate investment fund, for example, might allocate only 5-10% of its portfolio to New York residential properties{{ENDNOTE: While New York is the United States' fourth most populous state, it only constitutes 6% of the population. PLACEHOLDER - US Census Stats}}, with the remainder spread across commercial real estate, multi-family housing, and properties in other states. Even a complete exclusion from New York's single-family market would represent a limitation on one subset of potential investments rather than destruction of the fund's overall value.

The temporal nature of the restriction further undermines any bare residue claim. Unlike permanent prohibitions that eliminate property value indefinitely, the 90-day waiting period merely delays market entry. Institutional investors retain the ability to purchase properties after the waiting period expires, meaning their investment capacity is constrained but not eliminated. Courts applying *Gazza* would likely view this as a regulatory inconvenience rather than value destruction meeting the bare residue threshold. 

<!-- ## IV. Counterarguments and Defensive Considerations

### A. Police Power and Public Interest Justifications

New York can argue that RPL § 521 falls within the state's traditional police power to regulate real estate markets for public health, safety, and welfare.{{ENDNOTE:See Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U.S. 365 (1926) (upholding zoning as valid exercise of police power).}} Housing affordability constitutes a compelling state interest{{ENDNOTE:PLACEHOLDER - State constitutional or statutory commitment to housing affordability.}}, particularly given New York's housing crisis{{ENDNOTE:PLACEHOLDER - Data on New York housing crisis/affordability metrics.}} and the documented impact of institutional investment on housing costs.{{ENDNOTE:PLACEHOLDER - Studies showing institutional investment impact on housing prices.}}

The statute employs narrow tailoring by focusing only on single- and two-family homes—the segment most relevant to individual homeownership—while leaving apartment buildings and commercial properties unrestricted. This targeted approach suggests legislative care to minimize economic impact while achieving policy objectives.

### B. Rational Basis and Economic Regulation

As economic regulation rather than a fundamental rights restriction, RPL § 521 need only satisfy rational basis review.{{ENDNOTE:See FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 313 (1993) (rational basis standard for economic regulation).}} The legislation is rationally related to legitimate government interests in housing policy{{ENDNOTE:PLACEHOLDER - Constitutional authority for housing regulation.}}, supported by empirical evidence of institutional investment impacts on housing markets.{{ENDNOTE:PLACEHOLDER - Empirical studies on institutional investment and housing markets.}}

Courts have traditionally given significant deference to legislative judgments about economic regulation, particularly in areas like housing policy where states have extensive regulatory authority.{{ENDNOTE: PLACEHOLDER - find more citations for this}} -->

## IV. Conclusion

New York Real Property Law § 521 reveals the complex interaction between market access and housing policy. While the statute raises legitimate questions about regulatory takings and market interference, it likely does not run afoul of the prohibition on uncompensated takings. Unlike multi-year blanket prohibition at issue in *First English*, RPL § 521 preserves institutional investors' ultimate ability to purchase and use residential property while creating space for individual homebuyers to compete.

That said, there is nuance in the dialog around these housing policy debates that is often overlooked. The institutional investors affected by RPL § 521—including REITs, investment funds, and corporate property purchasers—are not faceless corporate entities extracting value from local communities. They are investment vehicles that channel the savings and retirement funds of ordinary Americans, including individuals like my grandfather, who seek real estate exposure without direct property ownership.{{ENDNOTE:PLACEHOLDER - Data on REIT ownership demographics and retirement fund investments.}}

The ultimate question is not whether institutional investors deserve access to residential property markets, but how society should balance the competing interests of current and prospective homebuyers who want to get on the property ladder, and retail investors who benefit from institutional investors having unfettered access to the property market. RPL § 521 represents one attempt to strike this balance, but it should be understood as affecting not just the balance sheets of Wall Street firms, but also the retirement accounts of everyday people.
