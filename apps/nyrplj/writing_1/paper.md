
"You can't lose!" my grandfather explained. I sat across from him in my grandparents' 500 square foot, 1 bedroom apartment. He was singing the praises of real estate investment trusts (REITs). It being 2007, his confidence in REITs was admittedly misplaced{{ENDNOTE:The 2008 financial crisis saw REIT returns decline significantly. See PLACEHOLDER - REIT performance data 2007-2008.}}, but the larger point is that REITs offered him a way to invest in real estate, despite not owning a home.

As of July 1st, 2025, the NY legislature has curtailed the access to single- and two-family homes for large institutional investors{{ENDNOTE:N.Y. Real Prop. Law § 521 (McKinney 2025).}} (like the ones offering my grandfather's REITs). NY RPL § 521 provides that institutional investors are subject to a 90-day waiting period before they are allowed to put in an offer on a single- and two-family homes{{ENDNOTE:Id. § 521(2).}}.

## I. Background: The Constitutional Framework for Regulatory Takings

### A. Federal Constitutional Basis

The Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause provides that private property shall not "be taken for public use, without just compensation."{{ENDNOTE:U.S. Const. amend. V.}} This protection extends beyond physical seizures to regulatory actions that effectively deprive property owners of economically viable use of their land{{ENDNOTE:See Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393 (1922) (establishing that regulations can constitute takings).}}. The Supreme Court has developed two primary categories of regulatory takings analysis: per se takings and ad hoc takings under the Penn Central test{{ENDNOTE:See Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc., 544 U.S. 528, 538 (2005) (describing the categorical framework for regulatory takings).}}.

Per se takings occur in two scenarios: permanent physical invasion of property{{ENDNOTE:Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419 (1982).}} or regulations that deprive property of "all economically beneficial use"{{ENDNOTE:Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003 (1992).}}. More commonly, courts apply the multi-factor balancing test established in Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City (1978){{ENDNOTE:Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104 (1978).}}, which considers: (1) the economic impact of the regulation, (2) the extent to which the regulation interferes with investment-backed expectations, and (3) the character of the governmental action{{ENDNOTE:Id. at 124.}}.

### B. New York State Constitutional Protections

Article I, § 7 of the New York Constitution mirrors federal takings protections{{ENDNOTE:N.Y. Const. art. I, § 7(a) ("Private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation.").}} but has been interpreted by state courts to impose a "heavy burden" on property owners challenging regulations{{ENDNOTE:PLACEHOLDER - NY state court precedent establishing heavy burden standard.}}. Under Matter of Gazza v. NY State Department of Environmental Conservation, claimants must demonstrate that regulation destroyed "all but a bare residue" of their property's value{{ENDNOTE:Matter of Gazza v. N.Y. State Dep't of Env't Conservation, 89 N.Y.2d 603, 608 (1997).}}. The New York Eminent Domain Procedure Law provides the exclusive remedy mechanism for compensation claims{{ENDNOTE:N.Y. Em. Dom. Proc. Law §§ 101-909 (McKinney 2025).}}.

### C. Temporal Considerations in Takings Analysis

The Supreme Court's decision in First English Evangelical Lutheran Church v. County of Los Angeles (1987) established that temporary takings, like permanent ones, require compensation{{ENDNOTE:First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U.S. 304, 318 (1987).}}. However, Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (2002) clarified that development moratoriums are generally not per se takings, requiring case-by-case analysis under Penn Central{{ENDNOTE:Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 535 U.S. 302, 321 (2002).}}. The duration and purpose of temporal restrictions remain crucial factors in determining whether compensation is required{{ENDNOTE:Id. at 342 (noting that context and duration are "defining characteristics" of regulatory takings analysis).}}.

## II. Statutory Analysis of NY Real Property Law § 521

### A. Structure and Scope of the 90-Day Waiting Period

New York Real Property Law § 521 introduces a mandatory 90-day waiting period for "covered entities" seeking to purchase single- or two-family residential properties{{ENDNOTE:N.Y. Real Prop. Law § 521(1) (McKinney 2025).}}. The statute includes several key provisions:

1. **Waiting Period Mechanism**: Covered entities cannot make offers on covered properties for 90 days following the property's initial listing for sale{{ENDNOTE:Id. § 521(2)(a).}}.

2. **Price Change Restart**: If the seller changes the asking price, a new 90-day period begins, potentially extending the exclusion period indefinitely through strategic pricing adjustments{{ENDNOTE:Id. § 521(2)(b).}}.

3. **Enforcement Provisions**: Violations carry civil penalties up to $250,000{{ENDNOTE:Id. § 521(5)(a).}}, with disclosure requirements for covered entities{{ENDNOTE:Id. § 521(3).}} and mandatory posting of waiting period information{{ENDNOTE:Id. § 521(4).}}.

4. **Effective Date**: The law took effect July 1, 2025{{ENDNOTE:PLACEHOLDER - Legislative history or enactment date citation.}}, applying to all properties listed after that date{{ENDNOTE:N.Y. Real Prop. Law § 521(6) (McKinney 2025).}}.

### B. Definition of "Covered Entities"

The statute defines covered entities by reference to RPL § 520{{ENDNOTE:N.Y. Real Prop. Law § 521(1) (referencing § 520 definition) (McKinney 2025).}}, encompassing institutional investors, investment funds, and certain corporate entities with substantial assets{{ENDNOTE:N.Y. Real Prop. Law § 520 (McKinney 2025) (defining covered entities).}}. This definition aims to distinguish between individual homebuyers and large-scale institutional investors while avoiding over-broad application to smaller investment entities or family limited partnerships{{ENDNOTE:PLACEHOLDER - Legislative intent or committee report citation.}}.

### C. Legislative Intent and Policy Objectives

The legislative record reveals three primary policy goals: (1) protecting individual homebuyers from institutional investor competition in tight housing markets{{ENDNOTE:PLACEHOLDER - Legislative record/committee report citation.}}, (2) addressing housing affordability concerns by reducing speculative investment{{ENDNOTE:PLACEHOLDER - Legislative findings on housing affordability impact.}}, and (3) preventing corporate consolidation of single-family housing stock that could reduce homeownership opportunities for working families{{ENDNOTE:PLACEHOLDER - Legislative findings on homeownership impact.}}.

## III. Regulatory Takings Analysis Under Current Doctrine

### A. Threshold Question: What Property Rights Are Affected?

RPL § 521 affects institutional investors' ability to participate immediately in residential property markets{{ENDNOTE:N.Y. Real Prop. Law § 521(2) (McKinney 2025).}}. Courts must first determine whether the right to compete for property purchases constitutes a cognizable property interest subject to Fifth Amendment protection{{ENDNOTE:PLACEHOLDER - Property rights doctrine on competitive opportunities.}}. While the Supreme Court has recognized that government interference with existing contracts or established business relationships can constitute a taking{{ENDNOTE:See, e.g., United States Trust Co. of New York v. New Jersey, 431 U.S. 1 (1977) (contract impairment); see also Allied Structural Steel Co. v. Spannaus, 438 U.S. 234 (1978).}}, the right to enter future contracts presents a more complex question{{ENDNOTE:PLACEHOLDER - Doctrine on prospective contractual rights as property.}}.

The statute does not prohibit institutional investors from ultimately purchasing properties—it merely delays their ability to compete{{ENDNOTE:N.Y. Real Prop. Law § 521(2) (McKinney 2025) (imposing waiting period, not permanent prohibition).}}. This temporal restriction resembles regulatory waiting periods in other contexts, such as securities trading cooling-off periods{{ENDNOTE:See, e.g., Securities Act of 1933 § 5, 15 U.S.C. § 77e (waiting periods for securities offerings).}} or environmental review requirements for development projects{{ENDNOTE:See National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. § 4321 et seq. (NEPA review requirements).}}.

### B. Penn Central Analysis Applied to RPL § 521

#### 1. Economic Impact

The economic impact of RPL § 521 varies significantly based on market conditions and investor business models. In rapidly appreciating markets, a 90-day delay could result in substantial opportunity costs if property values increase during the waiting period. However, in stable or declining markets, the delay may have minimal financial impact.

For institutional investors whose business models depend on rapid property acquisition—such as house-flipping operations or rental portfolio expansion—the statute creates measurable competitive disadvantages. The economic impact is compounded by the price-change restart provision, which allows sellers to potentially extend the waiting period indefinitely.

#### 2. Investment-Backed Expectations

Institutional investors argue they have reasonable investment-backed expectations in their ability to compete equally in residential property markets. They point to established business relationships, capital commitments to acquisition strategies, and regulatory frameworks that previously treated all qualified buyers equally.

However, the real estate market has long been subject to various regulatory restrictions, including zoning laws, rent control, and environmental regulations. Courts have generally held that investors enter regulated markets with notice of potential future restrictions. The question becomes whether RPL § 521 represents a fundamental change in regulatory approach or a reasonable extension of existing market regulation.

#### 3. Character of Government Action

RPL § 521 represents regulatory action rather than physical appropriation. The burden is distributed across a class of institutional investors rather than targeting specific entities. The statute serves the legitimate public purpose of promoting housing affordability and homeownership opportunities.

Significantly, the law does not transfer property from institutional investors to individual buyers—it merely adjusts the timing of market competition. This temporal shifting of competitive advantage differs from regulations that permanently exclude certain parties from market participation.

### C. Temporal Taking Analysis

The 90-day waiting period raises questions about temporary regulatory takings under First English. However, several factors distinguish RPL § 521 from the development moratorium at issue in that case:

1. **Limited Scope**: Unlike comprehensive development moratoriums, RPL § 521 affects only the timing of market entry, not the ultimate ability to acquire property.

2. **Market-Based Limitation**: The restriction operates within existing market mechanisms rather than halting all development or transfer activity.

3. **Recurring Application**: Each property listing triggers a new 90-day period, creating a predictable regulatory framework rather than an indefinite prohibition.

Courts applying Tahoe-Sierra's framework would likely examine whether the 90-day period, in the context of typical real estate transaction timelines, constitutes a meaningful deprivation of property rights or merely a reasonable regulatory delay.

## IV. Counterarguments and Defensive Considerations

### A. Police Power and Public Interest Justifications

New York can argue that RPL § 521 falls within the state's traditional police power to regulate real estate markets for public health, safety, and welfare{{ENDNOTE:See Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U.S. 365 (1926) (upholding zoning as valid exercise of police power).}}. Housing affordability constitutes a compelling state interest{{ENDNOTE:PLACEHOLDER - State constitutional or statutory commitment to housing affordability.}}, particularly given New York's housing crisis{{ENDNOTE:PLACEHOLDER - Data on New York housing crisis/affordability metrics.}} and the documented impact of institutional investment on housing costs{{ENDNOTE:PLACEHOLDER - Studies showing institutional investment impact on housing prices.}}.

The statute employs narrow tailoring by focusing only on single- and two-family homes—the segment most relevant to individual homeownership—while leaving apartment buildings and commercial properties unrestricted. This targeted approach suggests legislative care to minimize economic impact while achieving policy objectives.

### B. Rational Basis and Economic Regulation

As economic regulation rather than a fundamental rights restriction, RPL § 521 need only satisfy rational basis review{{ENDNOTE:See FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 313 (1993) (rational basis standard for economic regulation).}}. The legislation is rationally related to legitimate government interests in housing policy{{ENDNOTE:PLACEHOLDER - Constitutional authority for housing regulation.}}, supported by empirical evidence of institutional investment impacts on housing markets{{ENDNOTE:PLACEHOLDER - Empirical studies on institutional investment and housing markets.}}.

Courts have traditionally given significant deference to legislative judgments about economic regulation, particularly in areas like housing policy where states have extensive regulatory authority.

### C. Alternative Regulatory Approaches

Critics might argue that less restrictive alternatives could achieve the same policy goals, such as transfer taxes on institutional purchases or right-of-first-refusal systems for individual buyers. However, the availability of alternative approaches does not necessarily invalidate the chosen method, particularly when the regulation represents a reasonable policy choice within the state's regulatory authority.

## V. Practical Implications and Broader Context

### A. Market Effects and Unintended Consequences

RPL § 521 may produce several market effects beyond its stated objectives. Individual sellers might face reduced competition and potentially lower sale prices if institutional buyers represent a significant portion of market demand. Conversely, the law might stabilize housing prices by reducing speculative investment pressure.

The price-change restart provision creates potential for strategic manipulation, allowing sellers to effectively exclude institutional buyers indefinitely through repeated price adjustments. This mechanism could distort normal price discovery processes in residential markets.

### B. Interstate Commerce and Dormant Commerce Clause Considerations

While not directly addressing Commerce Clause issues, RPL § 521 could face challenges under the Dormant Commerce Clause if applied discriminatorily against out-of-state investors. The statute's definition of covered entities should be examined to ensure it does not disproportionately burden interstate commerce or favor in-state over out-of-state investors.

### C. Precedential Implications

RPL § 521 represents novel legislation targeting institutional investment in residential real estate. Its constitutional treatment will likely influence similar legislation in other states facing housing affordability challenges. The precedent set regarding temporal restrictions on market participation could extend to other regulated industries.

## VI. Assessment of Constitutional Challenges

### A. Likelihood of Successful Takings Claims

Under current regulatory takings doctrine, constitutional challenges to RPL § 521 face significant hurdles:

**Temporal Taking Claims** have moderate prospects under Penn Central analysis, particularly if institutional investors can demonstrate substantial economic impact in specific market conditions. However, the limited duration and scope of the restriction, combined with the availability of ultimate purchase rights, weaken per se temporal taking arguments.

**Regulatory Taking Claims** based on interference with business operations face a higher burden, given courts' general reluctance to find takings in economic regulation that preserves ultimate property use rights. The statute's narrow tailoring and clear public purpose provide strong defenses.

### B. Due Process and Equal Protection Considerations

Substantive due process challenges would apply rational basis review, requiring only that the law be rationally related to legitimate government interests. The clear nexus between institutional investment restrictions and housing affordability goals easily satisfies this standard.

Equal Protection analysis would similarly apply rational basis review, as institutional investors do not constitute a suspect class. The classification between institutional and individual purchasers bears a rational relationship to the statute's homeownership promotion objectives.

### C. Overall Constitutional Assessment

RPL § 521 likely survives constitutional challenge under current doctrine, despite novel questions about temporal market restrictions. The statute's narrow scope, clear public purpose, and preservation of ultimate purchase rights provide strong constitutional foundations. However, as-applied challenges in specific market conditions with documented severe economic impacts might succeed under Penn Central analysis.

## VII. Conclusion

The constitutional analysis of New York Real Property Law § 521 reveals the complex interaction between property rights and housing policy in contemporary America. While the statute raises legitimate questions about regulatory takings and market interference, it operates within established constitutional boundaries for economic regulation.

The 90-day waiting period represents a measured response to documented concerns about institutional investment's impact on housing affordability. Unlike blanket prohibitions or confiscatory regulations, RPL § 521 preserves institutional investors' ultimate ability to purchase residential property while creating space for individual homebuyers to compete.

Perhaps most importantly, this analysis illuminates a crucial irony in contemporary housing policy debates. The institutional investors affected by RPL § 521—including REITs, investment funds, and corporate property purchasers—are not faceless corporate entities extracting value from local communities. They are investment vehicles that channel the savings and retirement funds of ordinary Americans{{ENDNOTE:PLACEHOLDER - Data on REIT ownership demographics and retirement fund investments.}}, including individuals like my grandfather, who sought real estate exposure without direct property ownership.

When we restrict institutional investors' access to residential property, we indirectly limit the investment opportunities available to millions of Americans who rely on these institutions to diversify their portfolios and build long-term wealth{{ENDNOTE:PLACEHOLDER - Statistics on institutional investment in retirement portfolios.}}. The teacher contributing to a pension fund, the worker with a 401(k) account, and the retiree holding REIT shares all have indirect stakes in the residential property markets that RPL § 521 now regulates{{ENDNOTE:PLACEHOLDER - Data on pension fund and 401(k) real estate investments.}}.

This does not mean the statute is misguided—housing affordability represents a compelling public interest that may justify some restrictions on investment activity. Rather, it suggests that the political rhetoric surrounding "institutional investors" often obscures the reality that these entities represent the collective interests of millions of individual Americans seeking financial security.

The ultimate question is not whether institutional investors deserve access to residential property markets, but how society should balance the competing interests of current homebuyers, prospective homebuyers, and the millions of Americans whose financial security depends on the performance of institutional investment vehicles. RPL § 521 represents one attempt to strike this balance, but it should be understood as affecting not just Wall Street firms, but Main Street Americans whose retirement security depends on institutional investment returns.

In this light, the animosity often directed toward institutional investors in housing policy debates may be somewhat misplaced. The challenge is not to exclude institutional capital from housing markets, but to ensure that such capital serves broader social purposes while preserving opportunities for direct homeownership. As courts evaluate the constitutional boundaries of such regulation, they should consider not only the rights of institutional investors as business entities, but the interests of the millions of ordinary Americans who stand behind them.
