 - Hero: Individual Investment
 - Want: Exposure to Real Estate Without Purchasing a Home
 - Solution: Invest in Real Estate Investment Vehicles (REITs)
 - Obstacle: Governor Hochul's restriction on bidding on properties for the first 90 days
 - Potential solution: Uncompensated regulatory takings

# Paper Outline

## I. Introduction/Hook Paragraph - Human angle: There are everyday people on the other side of these institutional investors
   - My Grandfather
     - Modest lifestyle - lived 1-bedroom apt in senior living community for 30 years
     - Big fan of investing in REITs - "You can't lose!"
     - Then the 2008 financial crisis happened... but that's besides the point.
   - Transition to institutional investor perspective and legal question

## II. Background: Regulatory Takings Doctrine
   
   ### A. Constitutional Basis
      1. **Federal Framework (Fifth Amendment)**
         - Per se takings: permanent physical invasion OR total economic deprivation
         - Ad hoc takings: Penn Central balancing test
      2. **New York State Law (Article I, ยง 7 of NY Constitution)**
         - Mirrors federal approach but with additional considerations
         - "Heavy burden" on property owners (Matter of Gazza v. NY State Dep't of Envtl. Conservation)
         - Must show "all but a bare residue" of value destroyed
         - NY Eminent Domain Procedure Law provides exclusive remedy mechanism
   
   ### B. Supreme Court History of Regulatory Takings
      1. **Pennsylvania Coal v. Mahon (1922)** - Foundation: regulation that "goes too far" constitutes a taking
      2. **Penn Central Transportation Co. v. NYC (1978)** - Multi-factor balancing test:
         - Economic impact of regulation
         - Interference with investment-backed expectations
         - Character of governmental action
      3. **Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council (1992)** - Per se taking when regulation denies "all economically beneficial use"
      4. **Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV (1982)** - Permanent physical invasion = per se taking
      5. **Lingle v. Chevron (2005)** - Clarified framework, rejected "substantially advances" test   

   ### C. Temporal Aspects: Temporary vs. Permanent Takings
      1. **First English Evangelical Lutheran Church v. County of Los Angeles (1987)** - Temporary takings require compensation
      3. **Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (2002)** - Moratoriums generally not per se takings
      4. Duration and purpose of temporal restriction matters for analysis

## III. Statutory Analysis: NY Real Property Law ยง 521
   ### A. Text and Structure
      1. **90-day waiting period** - Covered entities cannot purchase single/two-family homes for 90 days after listing
      2. **Price change restart provision** - New 90-day period if seller changes asking price
      3. **Enforcement mechanisms** - Civil penalties up to $250,000, disclosure requirements
      4. **Effective date** - July 1, 2025

   ### B. Legislative Intent and Public Policy
      1. Protecting individual homebuyers from institutional investor competition
      2. Addressing housing affordability crisis
      3. Preventing corporate consolidation of residential housing market

   ### C. Definition and Scope of "Covered Entities"
      1. Reference to RPL ยง 520 (need to analyze definition)
      2. Institutional investors, investment funds, certain corporations

## IV. Regulatory Takings Analysis: Two Potential Theories

   ### A. Theory 1: Temporary Regulatory Taking
      #### 1. Legal Framework
         - First English establishes temporary takings require compensation
         - But Tahoe-Sierra limits application to development moratoriums
         - Key question: Does 90-day delay constitute sufficient temporal deprivation?

      #### 2. Penn Central Factors Applied
         **a. Economic Impact**
         - Quantifiable delay in acquisition opportunities
         - Time value of money - opportunity cost during 90-day period
         - Market dynamics: properties may become unavailable or appreciate in price

         **b. Investment-Backed Expectations**
         - Institutional investors' established business model of rapid property acquisition
         - Reasonable expectation of participating in competitive real estate markets
         - Prior investment in acquisition infrastructure and personnel

         **c. Character of Government Action**
         - Regulatory rather than physical appropriation
         - Burden distributed across class of institutional investors
         - Serves legitimate public purpose (housing affordability)

      #### 3. Temporal Considerations
         - 90 days is relatively brief compared to development moratoriums in Tahoe-Sierra (32 months)
         - Recurring nature: each new property listing triggers new 90-day period
         - Cumulative effect across investment portfolio

   ### B. Theory 2: Taking of Business/Property Interest
      #### 1. Property Rights in Business Operations
         - Right to compete in open markets as property interest
         - Business model itself as investment-backed expectation
         - Interference with contractual and commercial relationships

      #### 2. Economic Deprivation Analysis
         **a. Partial vs. Complete Deprivation**
         - Not total ban - investors can still purchase after 90 days
         - But significant competitive disadvantage in fast-moving markets
         - May render business model economically unviable

         **b. "All Economically Beneficial Use" Standard**
         - Under Lucas, must show complete economic deprivation
         - NY law requires showing "all but bare residue of value" destroyed
         - High bar unlikely to be met with 90-day delay alone

      #### 3. Penn Central Analysis for Business Taking
         **a. Economic Impact**
         - Lost acquisition opportunities during delay period
         - Reduced competitive advantage and market efficiency
         - Potential for increased costs and decreased returns

         **b. Investment-Backed Expectations**
         - Reliance on ability to compete equally in residential property markets
         - Established business relationships and acquisition strategies
         - Capital committed to rapid-acquisition business model

         **c. Character of Action**
         - Targeted regulation affecting specific class of market participants
         - Creates competitive advantage for individual buyers over institutional investors
         - Arguably shifts economic burdens rather than preventing harm

## V. Counterarguments and Challenges

   ### A. Police Power and Public Interest
      1. Legitimate state interest in housing affordability
      2. Regulation within traditional police power scope
      3. Balancing private property rights with public welfare

   ### B. Procedural and Practical Obstacles
      1. **Heavy Burden Standard in NY** - Must overcome presumption of constitutionality
      2. **Ripeness Requirements** - Final agency decision needed
      3. **Exhaustion of State Remedies** - Though Knick v. Township of Scott eliminated federal requirement
      4. **Standing Issues** - Particularized harm vs. general market regulation

   ### C. Alternative Regulatory Approaches
      1. Could state achieve same goals through less restrictive means?
      2. Right of first refusal systems vs. waiting periods
      3. Targeted taxes or fees instead of time delays

## VI. Practical Implications and Broader Context

   ### A. Market Effects
      1. Impact on housing liquidity and seller options
      2. Potential unintended consequences for housing market efficiency
      3. Effect on property values and market competition

   ### B. Constitutional Considerations Beyond Takings
      1. Due Process challenges (substantive and procedural)
      2. Equal Protection issues - differential treatment of buyer classes
      3. Commerce Clause implications for interstate investors

   ### C. Precedential Value
      1. First-of-its-kind legislation targeting institutional property investment
      2. Potential model for other states facing similar housing pressures
      3. Supreme Court's evolving takings jurisprudence

## VII. Conclusion
   ### A. Likelihood of Success for Takings Claims
      1. **Temporary Taking Theory**: Moderate prospects under Penn Central analysis
      2. **Business Taking Theory**: Lower prospects given high bar for per se takings
      3. Overall assessment based on current jurisprudential trends

   ### B. Policy Recommendations
      1. Alternative regulatory approaches that might achieve similar goals with less constitutional risk
      2. Compensation mechanisms that could satisfy Takings Clause requirements
      3. Need for empirical data on actual economic impact

   ### C. Broader Implications
      1. Tension between property rights and housing policy
      2. Role of courts vs. legislatures in addressing housing crisis
      3. Future of institutional investment regulation in residential real estate
