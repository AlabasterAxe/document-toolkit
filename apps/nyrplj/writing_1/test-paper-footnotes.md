"You can't lose!" my grandfather explained. I sat across from him in my grandparents' 500 square foot, 1 bedroom apartment. He was singing the praises of real estate investment trusts (REITs). It being 2007, his confidence in REITs was admittedly misplaced, but the larger point is that REITs offered him a way to invest in real estate, despite not owning a home.

As of July 1st, 2025, the NY legislature has curtailed the access to single- and two-family homes for large institutional investors (like the ones offering my grandfather's REITs). NY RPL § 521 provides that institutional investors are subject to a 90-day waiting period before they are allowed to put in an offer on a single- and two-family homes.{{FOOTNOTE:N.Y. Real Prop. Law § 521 (2025).}}

## I. Background: The Constitutional Framework for Regulatory Takings

### A. Federal Constitutional Basis

The Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause provides that private property shall not "be taken for public use, without just compensation."{{FOOTNOTE:U.S. Const. amend. V.}} This protection extends beyond physical seizures to regulatory actions that effectively deprive property owners of economically viable use of their land.{{FOOTNOTE:See Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393, 415 (1922) ("The general rule at least is, that while property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking.").}} The Supreme Court has developed two primary categories of regulatory takings analysis: per se takings and ad hoc takings under the Penn Central test.{{FOOTNOTE:See Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003, 1015 (1992); Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104, 124 (1978).}}

Per se takings occur in two scenarios: permanent physical invasion of property{{FOOTNOTE:Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419, 426 (1982).}} or regulations that deprive property of "all economically beneficial use."{{FOOTNOTE:Lucas, 505 U.S. at 1015.}} More commonly, courts apply the multi-factor balancing test established in Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City, which considers: (1) the economic impact of the regulation, (2) the extent to which the regulation interferes with investment-backed expectations, and (3) the character of the governmental action.{{FOOTNOTE:Penn Central, 438 U.S. at 124.}}

### B. New York State Constitutional Protections

Article I, § 7 of the New York Constitution mirrors federal takings protections but has been interpreted by state courts to impose a "heavy burden" on property owners challenging regulations.{{FOOTNOTE:Matter of Gazza v. NY State Dep't of Envtl. Conservation, 89 N.Y.2d 603, 611 (1997).}} Under Matter of Gazza v. NY State Department of Environmental Conservation, claimants must demonstrate that regulation destroyed "all but a bare residue" of their property's value.{{FOOTNOTE:Id. at 612.}} The New York Eminent Domain Procedure Law provides the exclusive remedy mechanism for compensation claims.{{FOOTNOTE:N.Y. Em. Dom. Proc. Law § 207 (McKinney 2024).}}

## VII. Conclusion

The constitutional analysis of New York Real Property Law § 521 reveals the complex interaction between property rights and housing policy in contemporary America. While the statute raises legitimate questions about regulatory takings and market interference, it operates within established constitutional boundaries for economic regulation.

Perhaps most importantly, this analysis illuminates a crucial irony in contemporary housing policy debates. The institutional investors affected by RPL § 521—including REITs, investment funds, and corporate property purchasers—are not faceless corporate entities extracting value from local communities. They are investment vehicles that channel the savings and retirement funds of ordinary Americans, including individuals like my grandfather, who sought real estate exposure without direct property ownership.{{FOOTNOTE:See generally John C. Bogle, The Little Book of Common Sense Investing 45-67 (2007) (discussing how institutional investment vehicles serve ordinary investors).}}

When we restrict institutional investors' access to residential property, we indirectly limit the investment opportunities available to millions of Americans who rely on these institutions to diversify their portfolios and build long-term wealth.{{FOOTNOTE:This effect is particularly pronounced in real estate investment trusts (REITs), which are required by law to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders. See 26 U.S.C. § 857(a)(1) (2024).}} The teacher contributing to a pension fund, the worker with a 401(k) account, and the retiree holding REIT shares all have indirect stakes in the residential property markets that RPL § 521 now regulates.

In this light, the animosity often directed toward institutional investors in housing policy debates may be somewhat misplaced. The challenge is not to exclude institutional capital from housing markets, but to ensure that such capital serves broader social purposes while preserving opportunities for direct homeownership.{{FOOTNOTE:For a thoughtful discussion of this balance, see Matthew Desmond, Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City 295-310 (2016).}}
