In May of this year, Governor Hochul signed legislation that requires institutional investors to wait 90 days before being able to purchase one- or two-family homes. I was interested in writing an article analyzing the vulnerability of this law to attack on the grounds of it being an uncompensated regulatory taking against the affected investment firms.

Professor Feedback:

As promised, we have reviewed your topic, and approve you to proceed.  In terms of regulatory takings, we would say it is nuanced body of law, so ensure you parse out the difference between a regulatory and physical taking, and keep an eye out for the jurisprudence that talks about temporary takings.

One other thing to think about:  While it is generally a federal constitutional concept, takings may also be claimed under the State Constitution as well.  You may want to take a look just in case there are state court cases on the subject.
