FACTS    

You are an intern at a mid-sized law firm specializing in employment law. Your supervisor has asked for your help researching an ongoing case and has provided you with the following background. 

Your client, Daisy Hernandez, graduated from Cornell University with a PhD in Botany in May 2023. Daisy wrote an award-winning dissertation on the management of plant diseases and was a sought-after candidate on the job market. Upon graduation, Daisy received numerous job interviews. One interview was with the Botany Conservation Alliance (“BCA”), a well-known Albany, NY non-profit focused on protecting the environment. Daisy enjoyed meeting the team at BCA and was excited that she would have the opportunity to focus her research on the management of plant diseases. Daisy was also looking forward to working with BCA’s Executive Director, Meagan Bishop, a world-renowned botanist.  

The interview process went well and Daisy was offered a full-time job with BCA with the title Research Scientist. The offer from BCA included an attractive package of salary, benefits, work-life balance, and the opportunity for advancement to management roles. Daisy also liked Albany and the numerous cultural, educational, and outdoor activities provided in the area. 

When discussing the offer with Cynthia Johnson, the head of Human Resources, Daisy asked if she could receive a contract that specified compensation and benefits as well as job protections, such as a specified number of years of employment. Daisy mentioned that she had received a number of other job offers and didn’t want to decline those without some job protection assurances from BCA. Cynthia said they could send an offer sheet with the compensation and benefits but not to worry about including a specified number of years because: “You are an excellent candidate with a bright future. Plus, our employee handbook provides protections regarding discharge.” 

The employee handbook provides, in pertinent part: Employees may be discharged at any time for just cause. In the event of a discharge for just cause an employee will be provided with written documentation outlining the reason(s) for discharge.

Based upon the offer sheet, the employee handbook, and her conversations with Cynthia, Daisy moved to Albany, signed a two-year apartment lease, and began working for BCA on September 1, 2023. 

Everything went well at work for the first six months. Daisy enjoyed working at BCA, established fruitful relations with her colleagues, and enjoyed her research. After six months, in February 2024, Daisy was promoted and received the title Associate Director of Research along with a 20% pay raise.  

After eight months, Meagan, BCA’s Executive Director, left to take a position heading the botany department at a major research university. A new Executive Director, Brian Richards, was hired in May 2024.  Brian was not interested in research efforts and wanted BCA to focus its resources on anti-deforestation lobbying and legislation. 

Brian asked Daisy to stop her plant disease research and focus on anti-deforestation lobbying. While Daisy felt anti-deforestation was an important issue, it was not her area of interest or expertise. Daisy had numerous discussions with Brian pushing back on the new job duties. On November 1, 2024, Daisy received a written termination notice signed by Brian. The termination notice stated that Daisy was an at-will employee and would receive two weeks’ compensation in connection with her employment termination. Daisy is seeking counsel to determine if she should bring a case against BCA for breach of an employment contract. Daisy claims that she relied on the representations made by Cynthia, including the language of the employee handbook, when accepting the job offer and declining other job offers.  

INSTRUCTIONS

However, I’m not convinced that they were as thorough or thoughtful as they could have been while conducting the research. Your job is to improve on the work they began. 

Part I – Research Process & Strategy Description
