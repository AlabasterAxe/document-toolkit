## Question Presented

### Purpose and Function
A Question Presented is a formal statement of your specific legal issue and the most relevant facts. It appears at the beginning of legal memoranda to give readers an overview of the case.

### Three Common Formats

#### 1. Under-Does-When Format
Written as a single sentence ending with a question mark, containing three parts:

- **Under**: Introductory clause identifying jurisdiction and type of law
- **Does**: Precise legal question using verbs like "does," "did," "can," "is," or "was"
- **When**: Two or more legally significant facts, typically introduced with "when" or "where"

*Example*: Under New York contract law, did the owner of a widget business make a binding offer to sell the business when she placed an ad for her business, but she mistakenly priced the business for a fraction of its worth?

#### 2. Multisentence Format
Uses multiple sentences (at least one statement and one question) to describe law, facts, and legal issue. Law and key facts are presented as statements; the legal issue as a question.

*Example*: New York law requires a binding offer for a contract to exist. Ms. Lee placed an advertisement to sell her widget business, but mistakenly priced the business at a fraction of its worth. Was Ms. Lee's advertisement a binding offer?

#### 3. Whether Format
More informal format beginning with "whether." Starts with the legal question, then lists key facts, often incorporating jurisdiction. Ends with a period despite being a phrase.

*Example*: Whether the owner of a widget business in New York made a binding offer to sell her business when she placed an ad to sell her business but mistakenly priced the business for a fraction of its worth.

### Key Requirements
- Identify jurisdiction for the legal question
- State the specific legal issue
- Include two or more legally significant facts
- Describe issue and facts objectively without bias
- Use parallel construction for clarity

## Brief Answer

### Structure and Purpose
The Brief Answer logically follows the Question Presented, providing a formal summary of your conclusion in three to five sentences with three main parts:

#### 1. Direct Answer (First Sentence)
- Provides direct "yes" or "no" answer to the Question Presented
- Often includes qualifying terms like "probably" since court outcomes cannot be predicted with absolute certainty
- Commonly begins with "probably yes" or "probably not"

#### 2. Rule Summary (Next 1-2 Sentences)
- Briefly summarizes applicable rules and anchors
- Provides legal foundation for the conclusion

#### 3. Analysis Summary (Final 1-2 Sentences)
- Summarizes analysis and conclusion
- Explains how facts fit with law and how conclusion was reached
- Avoids repeating facts from Question Presented

### Example Brief Answer
"Probably not. An advertisement is not an offer but a mere invitation to enter into a bargain. Even where a binding offer is made, the offeror can withdraw a mistaken offer if (1) she exercised ordinary care, (2) the other party was aware of the mistake, and (3) enforcement of the offer would be unconscionable. Here, a court would likely find that no offer was made because the advertisement merely invited buyers to make an offer to buy the business, and forcing the offeror to accept the low price listed in the advertisement would likely be deemed unconscionable."

### Key Requirements
- State answer as "yes" or "no" with hedging language if necessary
- Concisely summarize most important rules and anchors
- Answer the precise legal question with concise analysis supporting the answer
