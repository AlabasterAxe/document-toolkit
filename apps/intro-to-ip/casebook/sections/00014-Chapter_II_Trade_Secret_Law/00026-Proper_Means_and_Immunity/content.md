Although the UTSA does not contain any express exceptions to trade secret liability, the definition of misappropriation requires the trade secret owner to prove that the defendant acquired the trade secret by improper means. Independent discovery or reverse engineering are not improper. Thus, to the extent that a defendant can show that it reverse engineered or independently developed trade secret information, it can avoid liability. See Raytheon Co. v. Indigo Sys. Corp., 895 F.3d 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (crediting evidence of independent invention by a former employee after he left plaintiff's employ). The DTSA expressly provides that reverse engineering and independent invention are not improper means of acquiring a trade secret. DTSA 18 U.S.C. ยง1839(6)(B).

Furthermore, courts have long recognized that trade secret protection can "implicate the interest in freedom of expression or advance another significant public interest." See RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF UNFAIR COMPETITION, ยง40, comment c. The DTSA expressly immunizes whistleblowers-those who disclose trade secrets to the government or an attorney for purposes of reporting or investigating suspected illegal activity-from trade secret liability.
