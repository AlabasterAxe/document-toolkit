As the industrial revolution unfolded in the early 19th century, advances in iron casting processes, textile manufacturing, and other consumer product industries paved the way for mass producing decorative goods. As patents on these processes and products expired, competition shifted toward the decorative features. Ornamentation of useful articles did not, however, fit easily within utility patent or copyright protection. Although advances in the production processes and casting machinery were eligible for utility patents, the particular designs resulting from such processes and machinery did not qualify for utility patent protection. And copyright protection extended only to books, maps, charts, and prints, not to three-dimensional works.

England's more developed manufacturing economy had already confronted these issues through the enactment of a copyright-based design protection regime. Drawing on England's precedent, a successful American stove manufacturer, along with other industrialists and designers, petitioned Congress to enact design protection modeled on the British legislation. The Commissioner of Patents advocated the legislation in 1841, but under the "design patent" label and the Patent Office's authority. The design patent regime remains today, although copyright protection now extends to useful articles.

To obtain a design patent, a designer must submit an application to the PTO illustrating the design that satisfies four requirements: novelty, originality, ornamentality, and nonobviousness. The ornamentality requirement was intended to exclude design patent protection for functional features. Design patents have a term of 15 years from the grant date.
