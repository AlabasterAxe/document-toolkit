Intellectual property law has traditionally been taught along doctrinal lines. Separate courses have covered patent, copyright, and trademarks, with trade secrets often lost between the gaps. Yet the practice of intellectual property law increasingly cuts across these lines. Computer technology companies, for example, frequently require lawyers to address trade secret, copyright, patent, trademark, and antitrust issues simultaneously. Moreover, from a purely practical standpoint, clients are ultimately interested in appropriating a return from their investments, not in how many patents, copyrights, or trademarks their lawyers can obtain. Thus, intellectual property lawyers must possess an integrated understanding of these various fields to provide sound advice.

With this objective in mind, our book integrates the various modes of intellectual property in a functional manner. Before we begin this more detailed study, however, a brief survey of the overall landscape of intellectual property is in order. The following section sketches the elements of each of the principal modes of intellectual property protection in a comparative framework. These elements are summarized in Table 1-1. As an initial exploration, we conclude the chapter with a problem highlighting the integrated nature of intellectual property law and the challenges of applying its many branches to a real-world problem.
