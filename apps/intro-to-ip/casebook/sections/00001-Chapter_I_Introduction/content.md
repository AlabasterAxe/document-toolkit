The concept of property is among the oldest institutions of human civilization. It is widely recognized that people may own real property and tangible objects. The common law and the criminal law protect private property from interference by others. The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects private property against takings by the government for public use without just compensation. The philosophical bases for protection of private property are well entrenched in most societies: Private property results when labor is applied to nature, as an incentive for discovery, as an essential part of personhood, and as a foundation for an ordered economic system.

Ideas and information, by definition, are less tangible. They exist in the mind and work of humans. Legal protection for intellectual work evolved much later in the development of human society than did protection for tangible property. The protection of such "intellectual property" raises complex philosophical questions. Should the first person to discover a way of performing an important task-for example, a procedure for closing a wound-be entitled to prevent others from using this procedure? Should the first person to pen a phrase or hum a melody be entitled to prevent others from copying such words or singing the song? Should such "intellectual property rights" be more limited than traditional property rights (i.e., the fee simple)? This book explores the legal institutions and rules that have developed to protect intellectual property.

This chapter has two principal purposes. It first explores the principal philosophical foundations for the protection of intellectual property. Understanding the reasons why we protect intellectual property-and how those reasons differ from the justifications for real and other forms of tangible property-motivates the many legal rules that will follow in this book. The second section provides a comparative overview of the principal modes of intellectual property protection: trade secret, patent, copyright, and trademark/trade dress. Understanding the intellectual property landscape requires thinking about each form of intellectual property not just in isolation but as it interacts with the others. The remainder of this book explores these areas in detail, highlighting their logic and interplay in promoting progress in technology and the arts.
