Section 101 protects "any" "process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter" or "improvement thereof . . . subject to the conditions and requirements of this title." Essentially the same language has been part of U.S. patent law since 1790. Although the Patent Act has not expressly excluded any subject matter for much of U.S. history, ^7 courts have long recognized that there are limits on the types of inventions that are eligible for patenting. These limits emerged during the early to mid-nineteenth century as Anglo-American common law-trained jurists fleshed out the relatively terse requirements for patent eligibility.

Thus, we find the contours of these doctrines not in the text of the Patent Act but in two centuries of jurisprudence that has ebbed and flowed with technological advances, perspectives on scientific discovery, and concerns about whether the patent system encourages or stifles new inventions. Patent eligibility doctrines began to lose salience in the early 1980s as the Federal Circuit substantially liberalized the scope of patentable subject matter. The Supreme Court was silent on patentable subject matter from 1981 until 2010. Since then, the Court has issued four opinions that have redrawn the boundaries of patent eligible subject matter and reinvigorated litigation in the area. See Bilskiv. Kappos, 561 U.S. 593 (2010); Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Labs., Inc., 566 U.S. 66 (2012); Ass'n for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., 569 U.S. 576 (2013); Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank Int'l, 573 U.S. 208 (2014). Most patents in force today issued when the subject matter eligible for patent protection was broader. Consequently, the number of invalidations based on §101 has grown substantially since 2010.

Navigating the boundaries of patentable subject matter requires careful study of the Supreme Court's recent decisions as well as the history that led to these cases.

# i. The Evolution of Patentable Subject Matter Limitations 

Like the modern Patent Act, the nation's first patent statutes authorized granting of patents for a broad range of subject matter-"any new and useful art, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter"-without express limitations. Courts came to recognize that patentability of broad scientific principles and abstract claims created the need for patent eligibility and scope limitations-what we today consider §112 concerns. These concepts were intertwined in the early jurisprudence and continue to overlap today.

## a. Early Development of Patent Eligibility Limitations

In the years following the nation's founding, English cases greatly influenced American jurisprudence. Intellectual property law followed English statutes and traditions particularly closely.

With the industrial revolution picking up steam (so to speak), courts on both sides of the Atlantic struggled to delineate claims for groundbreaking inventions, such as the steam engine, sewing machine, telegraph, and telephone. Scientific discoveries in metallurgy, chemistry, and electricity fueled the industrial revolution. Patenting of the hot blast process, which historians view as "the most important single innovation in the industry in the age of iron," would prove especially significant to patent eligibility doctrine. See Alan Birch, The Economic History Of The British Iron And Steel INDUSTRY 1784-1879, 181 (1968).

Scottish inventor James Beaumont Neilson challenged the conventional wisdom that hot blast furnaces worked best if they were fed cold air. Instead, Neilson preheated the air entering a furnace which substantially reduced the fuel required and enabled the use of raw coal and lower quality ores. Neilson's patent provided few details. The specification declared broadly that the composition of the air vessel, the manner of applying heat, and " [t] he form or shape of the receptacle" are immaterial to the effect.

Neilson sued numerous ironmakers for patent infringement. The litigation led to the decision in the English Court of the Exchequer, Neilson v. Harford (1841), that still reverberates in U.S. patent jurisprudence today. The patent was attacked on the ground that a patent for injecting hot air into the furnace, instead of cold, and thereby increasing the intensity of the heat, was a patent for a principle, and that an abstract (unapplied) principle was not patentable. In upholding the patent, the court reasoned that since the principle worked regardless of the dimensions of the receptacle in which the air was preheated, Neilson's invention did not claim the principle itself but an application of the principle, if a broad one, and thus was patent-eligible.
U.S. courts followed the English approach. They barred protection for a mere "principle," "motive" force, or "new power" in the abstract, but allowed patents on applications of newly discovered laws of nature. The Supreme Court explained in Le Roy v. Tatham, where a patent claimed both improved machinery for manufacturing lead pipe and a new property (the manufacture of wrought pipe from solid lead under heat and pressure), that [a] principle, in the abstract, is a fundamental truth; an original cause; a motive; these cannot be patented, as no one can claim in either of them an exclusive right. Through the agency of machinery a new steam power may be said to have been generated. But no one can appropriate this power exclusively to himself, under the patent laws. The same may be said of electricity, and of any other power in nature, which is alike open to all, and may be applied to useful purposes by the use of machinery.

In all such cases, the processes used to extract, modify, and concentrate natural agencies, constitute the invention. The elements of the power exist; the invention is not in discovering them, but in applying them to useful objects. . . . 55 U.S. (14 How.) 156, 175 (1853) (emphasis added).

As we saw carlier, the Supreme Court addressed Neilson again the following year in O'Reilly v. Morse, 56 U.S. (15 How.) 62 (1853). While endorsing the requirement that patents must apply a law of nature, the Court nonetheless distinguished Neilson's claim from Morse's final claim. Whereas the effect that Neilson claimed (improving the functioning of a hot blast furnace) produced the desired effect for "whatever might be the form of the receptacle, or the mechanical contrivances for heating it, or for passing the current of air through it, and into the furnace," Morse had "not discovered, that the electric or galvanic current will always print at a distance, no matter what may be the form of the machinery or mechanical contrivances through which it passes." Id. at 11617.

By the end of the nineteenth century, American patent eligibility doctrine merely required that the patentee "carry the principle into effect, however simple and selfevident such means may be." See David Fulton, The Law and Practice Relating to Patents, Trade Marks and Designs 41 (1902); see also Robert Frost, A Treatise on The Law and Practice of Letters Patent for Inventions 36 (1891) ("Principles in a concrete form, together with a mode of applying them to a new and useful purpose, may form the subject of a grant of letters patent. . . . It is not necessary that the means, as well as the principle, should be new, for the novelty of the invention consists in applying the new principle by the means specified."). This view continued well into the twentieth century. See CAESAR \& RIVISE, Patentability and Validity, §§33,34 (1936) (observing that "[i]n the cases where the inventor was required to be also the discoverer of the law or force utilized, it appeared that the application or utilization of the law became self-evident as soon as the principle was formulated").

# b. Funk Brothers: The Emergence of Eligibility Skepticism 

The Supreme Court's decision in Funk Brothers Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co., 333 U.S. 127 (1948), curtailed patent protection for natural products. The patentee in the case, Kalo Inoculant Company, claimed An inoculant for leguminous plants comprising a plurality of selected mutually non-inhibitive strains of different species of bacteria of the genus Rhizobium, said strains being unaffected by each other in respect to their ability to fix nitrogen in the leguminous plant for which they are selected.
Such bacteria promote plant growth. When the invention was made, it was known that bacteria of the genus Rhizobium naturally exist in symbiosis with leguminous plants, such as peas and beans. Farmers routinely mixed Rhizobium cultures with leguminous plants to fix nitrogen from the air into the soil. Unfortunately, particular species of the Rhizobium genus can colonize only particular legumes. Mixing different Rhizobium species into a single commercial product, however, proved unsuccessful. The bacteria species exert inhibitory effects on each other when mixed together. As a result, farmers needed to apply separate cultures to each leguminous crop, adding cost and complication. Kalo discovered that particular combinations of naturally occurring Rhizobium bacteria were not inhibitory and, therefore, could be packaged together into a product to be applied across leguminous plants more conveniently. He claimed, however, not a specific combination of bacteria but the idea of combining noninhibitory strains, whatever they turned out to be.

A divided Supreme Court invalidated the patent on eligibility grounds: it did "not disclose an invention or discovery within the meaning of the patent statutes." Funk Bros., 333 U.S. at 132. The Court explained:
[P]atents cannot issue for the discovery of phenomena of nature. The qualities of these bacteria, like the heat of the sun, electricity, or the quality of metals, are part of the storehouse of knowledge of all men. They are manifestations of laws of nature, free to all men and reserved exclusively to none. He who discovers a hitherto unknown phenomenon of nature has no claim to a monopoly of it which the law recognizes. If there is to be invention from such a discovery, it must come from the application of the law of nature to a new and useful end. . . .

Discovery of the fact that certain strains of each species of these bacteria can be mixed without harmful effect to the properties of either is a discovery of their qualities of non-inhibition. It is no more than the discovery of some of the handiwork of nature and hence is not patentable. The aggregation of select strains of the several species into one product is an application of that newlydiscovered natural principle. But however ingenious the discovery of that natural principle may have been, the application of it is hardly more than an advance in the packaging of the inoculants.
Id. at 131 (emphasis added). Justice Douglas acknowledged that the inventor had applied the law of nature, but nonetheless invalidated the claim as insufficiently inventive in its application of the newly-discovered natural principle. The Court noted that a product must be more than new and useful to be patented; it must also satisfy the requirements of invention or discovery. Cuno Eng'g Corp. v. Automatic Devices Corp., 314 U.S. 84, 90, 91 (1941), and cases cited; 35 U.S.C. §31. The application of this newly-discovered natural principle to the problem of packaging of inoculants may well have been an important commercial advance. But once nature's secret of the non-inhibitive quality of certain strains of the species of Rhizobium was discovered, the state of the art made the production of a mixed inoculant a simple step. Even though it may have been the product of skill, it certainly was not the product of invention.
Id. at 131-32.
In a concurring opinion, Justice Frankfurter offered an alternate basis for invalidation reminiscent of the Morse decision. In his view, the patent was invalid not for unpatentable subject matter but rather for want of adequate identification of successful combinations of mutually non-inhibitory bacteria. Funk Bros., 333 U.S. at 133. He went on to observe It only confuses the issue . . . to introduce such terms as 'the work of nature' and the 'laws of nature.' For these are vague and malleable terms infected with too much ambiguity and equivocation. Everything that happens may be deemed 'the work of nature,' and any patentable composite exemplifies in its properties 'the laws of nature.' Arguments drawn from such terms for ascertaining patentability could fairly be employed to challenge almost every patent.
Id. at 134-35.^8

# c. The New Technological Age 

The dawn of the digital age presented new patent eligibility issues for the Supreme Court. The inventor in Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U.S. 63 (1972), claimed an algorithm for converting binary-coded decimal numerals into pure binary numerals. In upholding the PTO's rejection of the patent on subject matter grounds, a unanimous Court, drawing upon Le Roy, Morse, and Funk Brothers, articulated three principles for determining whether a process is patentable: (1) "[p]henomena of nature, though just discovered, mental processes, and abstract intellectual concepts are not patentable, as they are the basic tools of scientific and technological work," id. at 67 ; (2) "[t]ransformation and reduction of an article 'to a different state or thing' is the clue to the patentability of a process claim that does not include particular machines," id. at 70; and (3) algorithms may not be patented so as to avoid the practical effect of "wholly pre-empt[ing a] mathematical formula," id. at 71 . Echoing concerns raised by various amicus briefs, the Court concluded by calling on Congress to take up the question of whether and to what extent computer programs ought to be patentable. See id. at 71-73.

Six years later in Parker v. Flook, 437 U.S. 584 (1978), the Supreme Court addressed whether a procedure for updating an alarm limit-measuring the present value of a process variable (such as temperature), using an algorithm to calculate an updated alarm-limit value, and adjusting the updated value-was eligible for patent protection. Writing for the majority in a sharply divided opinion. Justice Stevens expressly embraced an inventive application doctrine in upholding the PTO's rejection of the claim. The Court grounded the doctrine on the statement in Neilson that "the case must be considered as if the principle being well known, the plaintiff had first invented a mode of applying it . . "" Flook, 437 U.S. at 592 (quoting Morse, quoting Neilson). Based on this sentence from Neilson, the Supreme Court reasoned that "this case must also be considered as if the principle or mathematical formula were well known" and that patent eligibility required sufficient inventiveness beyond the application of the algorithm to be within the scope of patentable subject matter. Id. at 592, 594-95. The Court declared:

Even though a phenomenon of nature or mathematical formula may be well known, an inventive application of the principle may be patented. Conversely, the discovery of such a phenomenon cannot support a patent unless there is some other inventive concept in its application.
Id. at 594 (emphasis added).
Query: Did the Court interpret Neilson (and Morse's interpretation of Neilson) correctly?

Justice Stewart, with whom Chief Justice Burger and Justice Rehnquist joined, dissenting, did not see the patent at issue as pre-empting use of the algorithm, but rather as a potentially patentable application of it. Id. at 599 . He criticized the majority opinion for excluding a process from the scope of patentable subject matter because "one step in the process would not be patentable subject matter if considered in isolation." The dissent observed that "thousands of processes and combinations have been patented that contained one or more steps or elements that themselves would have been unpatentable subject matter." Id. (citation omitted; emphasis in original). The majority opinion responded to this contention by noting that the process is unpatentable "not because it contains a mathematical algorithm as one component, but because once that algorithm is assumed to be within the prior art, the application, considered as a whole, contains no patentable invention," id. at 594-the inventive application doctrine.

As the Court grappled with the patentability of computer software, it also confronted the patentability of genetically modified organisms. See Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303 (1980). The inventor claimed a self-replicating bacterium into which he had injected oil-degrading plasmids that could be used in dispersing oil spills. Id. at 305. The PTO rejected the claim on the grounds that microorganisms are "products of nature" and living things, both of which make them ineligible for patent protection under §101. Id. at 306. The Court of Customs and Patent Appeals reversed, upholding the claim under the standards set forth in Flook.

The Supreme Court affirmed the appellate court decision, opening the way for patent protection for genetically modified organisms. Id. at 318. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Burger characterized the Constitution's grant of patent legislative authority and §101 's text broadly. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. at 307-08. While recognizing the unpatentability of "laws of nature, physical phenomena, and abstract ideas," the Court judged Chakrabarty's claim to a "nonnaturally occurring manufacture or composition of matter-a product of human ingenuity "having a distinctive name, character [and] use"-to "plainly" qualify for patent eligibility. Id. at 309-10 (quoting Hartranft v. Wiegmann, 121 U.S. 609, 615 (1887)). Drawing a contrast to Funk Brothers, the Court noted that Chakrabarty "has produced a new bacterium with markedly different characteristics from any found in nature and one having the potential for significant utility. His discovery is not nature's handiwork, but his own." Id. at 310.^9

Moreover, Chakrabarty interpreted the scope of patent-eligible subject matter expansively, stressing that §101 encompasses any invention falling within the four designated categories. Id. at 308-09. The Supreme Court also looked to the legislative history of the 1952 Patent Act, from which it concluded that "Congress intended statutory subject matter to 'include anything under the sun that is made by man." ^10Id. at 309 .

Propelled in part by Chakrabarty's broad reading of patent eligibility, the pendulum swung decisively away from Flook the next year. Writing for the majority, Justice Rehnquist explained that processes have been eligible for patent protection since the 1793 Act and referenced the statement from Benson that "[t]ransformation and reduction of an article 'to a different state or thing' is the clue to the patentability of a process claim that does not include particular machines." Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U.S. 175, 184 (1981) (quoting Benson, 409 U.S. at 70). The Court concluded that "a physical and chemical process for molding precision synthetic rubber products falls within the §101 categories of possibly patentable subject matter." Id. Justice Rehnquist purported to distinguish Benson and Flook before proclaiming that "[o]ur earlier opinions lend support to our present conclusion that a claim drawn to subject matter otherwise statutory does not become nonstatutory simply because it uses a mathematical formula, computer program, or digital computer." Id. at 187. The Court emphasized that process claims are properly analyzed as a whole. It is inappropriate to dissect the claims into old and new elements and then to ignore the presence of the old elements in the analysis. This is particularly true in a process claim because a new combination of steps in a process may be patentable even though all the constituents of the combination were well known and in common use before the combination was made. The 'novelty' of any element or steps in a process, or even of the process itself, is of no relevance in determining whether the subject matter of a claim falls within the §101 categories of possibly patentable subject matter.
Id. at 188-89. In so holding, Justice Rehnquist seemed to overrule Flook's requirement of inventive application. He reiterated, however, that "a mathematical formula as such" is not patentable nor is limiting the use of a formula to a particular technological environment, citing Benson and Flook. Id. at 191. The touchstone for patentability of a process embodying a mathematical formula, according to the majority opinion, is significant post-solution activity-i.e., "transforming or reducing an article to a different state or thing." Id. at 191-92.

Justice Stevens, joined by Justices Brennan, Marshall, and Blackmun, dissented, emphasizing that the majority eviscerated Flook's inventive application requirement. To the dissenters, if the inventor's "method is regarded as an 'algorithm' as that term was used" in Benson and Flook, "and if no other inventive concept is disclosed in the patent application," then the claim falls outside the scope of patentable processes under §101. Id. at 213-14. Moreover, the dissenters contended that "the postsolution activity described in the Flook application was no less significant than the automatic opening of the curing mold involved in [Diehr]." Id. at 215.

# d. The Rise of the Federal Circuit and Dismantling of Patentable Subject Matter Limitations 

In the ensuing three decades, the Federal Circuit gradually eroded patent eligibility limitations. Building off of Diehr, the Federal Circuit chipped away at the post-solution activity necessary to bring software-related claims within §101. See, e.g., In re Alappat, 33 F.3d 1526 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (holding that the display of data on a computer screen could suffice). Similarly, the Federal Circuit endorsed the PTO's policy of permitting the patenting of isolated DNA molecules. See Amgen, Inc. v. Chugai Pharm. Co., 927 F.2d 1200 (Fed. Cir. 1991). In a departure from prior jurisprudence-see Hotel Sec. Checking Co. v. Lorraine Co., 160 Fed. 467, 469, 479 (2d Cir. 1908); William Anthony Deller, 1 Walker on Patents: Deller's Edition, 62, 69 (1937)-the Federal Circuit "la[id the] ill-conceived [business method] exception to rest." State St. Bank v. Signature Fin. Grp., 149 F.3d 1368, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 1998). At the time, the Supreme Court declined to weigh in on these controversies.

The Federal Circuit's loosening of patent eligibility standards expanded the range of patents being issued. The PTO shifted its position from skepticism about expansive patent eligibility to openness and even enthusiasm. Patents for software, DNA, and business methods flooded the PTO. Entrepreneurs and venture capitalists saw patenting as a valuable tool for developing (or at least claiming) Intemet businesses. The late 1990s witnessed unprecedented growth of start-up businesses based on speculative initial public offerings secured, in part, on patent portfolios.

The bursting of the Internet (dot-com) stock bubble in 2000 produced a dramatic shake-out. Bankruptcies and subsequently, the auctioning and trading of Internet-related patents, became widespread. Entities whose sole purpose was to assert these patents emerged. Patent holding companies and non-practicing entities sought to monetize their Internet patents, purchased at fire sales. Lawsuits by patent assertion entities produced a tidal wave of patent validity challenges as well as calls by Silicon Valley companies, policymakers, and scholars for policy reform.

In the late 2000s the Federal Circuit issued several decisions that cautiously reintroduced limits on patent eligibility. See, e.g., In re Nuijten, 500 F.3d 1346 (Fed.
Cir. 2007) (holding that a watermarked electromagnetic signal does not fall into any of the four categories of patent-eligible subject matter); In re Comiskey, 499 F.3d 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2007), amended by 554 F.3d 967 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (affirming rejection of a business method patent under §101 as merely relying on mental steps). Most notably, the Federal Circuit, sitting en banc, attempted to clarify the boundaries of patentable subject matter under §101. See In re Bilski, 545 F.3d 943 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (en banc).

Bilski claimed a method of managing risk of commodity prices-a business method that a computer could implement:

A method for managing the consumption risk costs of a commodity sold by a commodity provider at a fixed price comprising the steps of:
(a) initiating a series of transactions between said commodity provider and consumers of said commodity wherein said consumers purchase said commodity at a fixed rate based upon historical averages, said fixed rate corresponding to a risk position of said consumer;
(b) identifying market participants for said commodity having a counterrisk position to said consumers; and (c) initiating a series of transactions between said commodity provider and said market participants at a second fixed rate such that said series of market participant transactions balances the risk position of said series of consumer transactions.
Claim 1, U.S. Patent Application No. 08/833,892. In an effort to harmonize the Supreme Court's Benson, Flook, and Diehr precedents, the Federal Circuit articulated the "machine-or-transformation" (MoT) test "to determine whether a process claim is tailored narrowly enough to encompass only a particular application of a fundamental principle rather than to pre-empt the principle itself." Under the MoT test, a claimed process is patent-eligible under §101 if: "(1) it is tied to a particular machine or apparatus, or (2) it transforms a particular article into a different state or thing." The court concluded that the Bilski patent failed both prongs and hence was unpatentable: it was not tied to a "particular" machine. Further, the transformation of legal obligations or relationships, business risks, or other abstractions is not a tangible change, eligible for patent protection.

# ii. The Supreme Court's Revival of Subject Matter Limitations 

The Supreme Court opened a new chapter in patent eligibility jurisprudence with its grant of review in the Bilski case. The majority ruled that Bilski's broad independent claim to hedging was "an unpatentable abstract idea, just like the algorithms at issue in Benson and Flook. Allowing petitioners to patent risk hedging would pre-empt use of this approach in all fields, and would effectively grant a monopoly over an abstract idea." Id. at 611-12. The Court further rejected Bilski's narrower dependent claims as unpatentable by reference to Flook, which "established that limiting an abstract idea to one field of use or adding token postsolution components did not make the concept patentable." Id.
While affirming the Federal Circuit's decision holding Bilski's hedging patent application invalid, the Supreme Court rejected the MoT test as the sole test of patent eligibility of process claims. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court characterized the MoT test as a "useful and important clue, an investigative tool, for determining whether some claimed inventions are processes under §101," but too rigid given the broad statutory definition in §100 (b) of "process." Id. at 603-04. While recognizing the jurisprudentially developed exclusions for laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas, the Court nonetheless warned that the judiciary does not have "carte blanche to impose other limitations that are inconsistent with the text and the statute's purpose and design." Id. at 603 . On similar grounds, the majority rejected the argument that business methods are categorically excluded from patent eligibility. Id. at 606-08.

Justice Stevens, joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor, concurred in the judgment, but contended that the Patent Act and jurisprudence have long categorically excluded business methods from patent eligibility. Id. at 613. The opinion grounded its conclusion in constitutional limits on legislative power. Article I, §8, cl. 8 authorizes Congress to grant patents for discoveries so as to promote "useful Arts." The "useful Arts" translate to "technology" in modern parlance. Justice Stevens did not believe that innovations in business methods fell within this domain. "During the 17th and 18th centuries, Great Britain saw innovations in business organization, business models, management techniques, and novel solutions to the challenges of operating global firms[, yet f]ew if any of these methods of conducting business were patented." Id. at 631 (footnotes omitted).

The Supreme Court then turned to patents on medical diagnostic processes.

Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. Supreme Court of the United States 566 U.S. 66 (2012)

JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.
Section 101 of the Patent Act defines patentable subject matter. It says:
Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.
The Court has long held that this provision contains an important implicit exception. "[L]aws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas" are not patentable. Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U.S. 175, 185 (1981); Le Roy v. Tatham, 14 How. 156, 175 (1853); O'Reilly v. Morse, 15 How. 62, 112-120 (1854); cf. Neilson v. Harford, Webster's Patent Cases 295, 371 (1841) (English case discussing same). Thus, the Court has written that "a new mineral discovered in the earth or a new plant found in the wild is not patentable subject matter. Likewise, Einstein could not patent his celebrated law that E=mc^2; nor could Newton have patented the law of gravity. Such discoveries are 'manifestations of ... nature, free to all men and reserved exclusively to none.'"
Chakrabarty, supra, at 309 (quoting Funk Brothers Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co., 333 U.S. 127, 130 (1948)).
"Phenomena of nature, though just discovered, mental processes, and abstract intellectual concepts are not patentable, as they are the basic tools of scientific and technological work." Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U.S. 63, 67 (1972). And monopolization of those tools through the grant of a patent might tend to impede innovation more than it would tend to promote it.

The Court has recognized, however, that too broad an interpretation of this exclusionary principle could eviscerate patent law. For all inventions at some level embody, use, reflect, rest upon, or apply laws of nature, natural phenomena, or abstract ideas. Thus, in Diehr the Court pointed out that "a process is not unpatentable simply because it contains a law of nature or a mathematical algorithm." 450 U.S., at 187 (quoting Parker v. Flook, 437 U.S. 584, 590 (1978)). It added that "an application of a law of nature or mathematical formula to a known structure or process may well be deserving of patent protection." Diehr, supra, at 187. And it emphasized Justice Stone's similar observation in Mackay Radio \& Telegraph Co. v. Radio Corp. of America, 306 U.S. 86 (1939):
"'While a scientific truth, or the mathematical expression of it, is not a patentable invention, a novel and useful structure created with the aid of knowledge of scientific truth may be." 450 U.S., at 188 (quoting Mackay Radio, supra, at 94 ).
See also Funk Brothers, supra at 130 ("If there is to be invention from [a discovery of a law of nature], it must come from the application of the law of nature to a new and useful end").

Still, as the Court has also made clear, to transform an unpatentable law of nature into a patent-eligible application of such a law, one must do more than simply state the law of nature while adding the words "apply it." See, e.g., Benson, supra, at 71-72.

The case before us lies at the intersection of these basic principles. It concerns patent claims covering processes that help doctors who use thiopurine drugs to treat patients with autoimmune diseases determine whether a given dosage level is too low or too high. The claims purport to apply natural laws describing the relationships between the concentration in the blood of certain thiopurine metabolites and the likelihood that the drug dosage will be ineffective or induce harmful side-effects. We must determine whether the claimed processes have transformed these unpatentable natural laws into patent-eligible applications of those laws. We conclude that they have not done so and that therefore the processes are not patentable.

Our conclusion rests upon an examination of the particular claims before us in light of the Court's precedents. Those cases warn us against interpreting patent statutes in ways that make patent eligibility "depend simply on the draftsman's art" without reference to the "principles underlying the prohibition against patents for [natural laws]." Flook, supra, at 593. They warn us against upholding patents that claim processes that too broadly preempt the use of a natural law. Morse, supra, at 112-120;
Benson, supra, at 71-72. And they insist that a process that focuses upon the use of a natural law also contain other elements or a combination of elements, sometimes referred to as an "inventive concept," sufficient to ensure that the patent in practice amounts to significantly more than a patent upon the natural law itself. Flook, supra, at 594; see also Bilski, supra, at 3218 ("[T]he prohibition against patenting abstract ideas 'cannot be circumvented by attempting to limit the use of the formula to a particular technological environment' or adding 'insignificant postsolution activity'" (quoting Diehr, supra, at 191-192)).

We find that the process claims at issue here do not satisfy these conditions. In particular, the steps in the claimed processes (apart from the natural laws themselves) involve well-understood, routine, conventional activity previously engaged in by researchers in the field. At the same time, upholding the patents would risk disproportionately tying up the use of the underlying natural laws, inhibiting their use in the making of further discoveries.

# I 

A The patents before us concern the use of thiopurine drugs in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. When a patient ingests a thiopurine compound, his body metabolizes the drug, causing metabolites to form in his bloodstream. Because the way in which people metabolize thiopurine compounds varies, the same dose of a thiopurine drug affects different people differently, and it has been difficult for doctors to determine whether for a particular patient a given dose is too high, risking harmful side effects, or too low, and so likely ineffective.

At the time the discoveries embodied in the patents were made, scientists already understood that the levels in a patient's blood of certain metabolites, including, in particular, 6-thioguanine and its nucleotides (6-TG) and 6-methyl-mercaptopurine (6MMP), were correlated with the likelihood that a particular dosage of a thiopurine drug could cause harm or prove ineffective. See U.S. Patent No. 6,355,623, col.8, 11.37-40, 2 App. 10. ("Previous studies suggested that measurement of 6-MP metabolite levels can be used to predict clinical efficacy and tolerance to azathioprine or 6-MP" (citing Cuffari, Théorêt, Latour, \& Seidman, 6-Mercaptopurine Metabolism in Crohn's Disease: Correlation with Efficacy and Toxicity, 39 GUT 401 (1996))). But those in the field did not know the precise correlations between metabolite levels and likely harm or ineffectiveness. The patent claims at issue here set forth processes embodying researchers' findings that identified these correlations with some precision.

More specifically, the patents-U.S. Patent No. 6,355,623 ('623 patent) and U.S. Patent No. 6,680,302 ('302 patent)-embody findings that concentrations in a patient's blood of 6-TG or of 6-MMP metabolite beyond a certain level ( 400 and 7000 picomoles per 810^8 red blood cells, respectively) indicate that the dosage is likely too high for the patient, while concentrations in the blood of 6-TG metabolite lower than a certain level (about 230 picomoles per 810^8 red blood cells) indicate that the dosage is likely too low to be effective.

The patent claims seek to embody this research in a set of processes. Like the Federal Circuit we take as typical claim 1 of the ' 623 Patent, which describes one of the claimed processes as follows:
"A method of optimizing therapeutic efficacy for treatment of an immunemediated gastrointestinal disorder, comprising:
"(a) administering a drug providing 6 -thioguanine to a subject having said immune-mediated gastrointestinal disorder; and "(b) determining the level of 6 -thioguanine in said subject having said immune-mediated gastrointestinal disorder, "wherein the level of 6 -thioguanine less than about 230 pmol per 8108 red blood cells indicates a need to increase the amount of said drug subsequently administered to said subject and "wherein the level of 6 -thioguanine greater than about 400 pmol per 8108 red blood cells indicates a need to decrease the amount of said drug subsequently administered to said subject." ' 623 patent, col.20, 11.10-20, 2 App. 16 .
For present purposes we may assume that the other claims in the patents do not differ significantly from claim 1....

# II 

Prometheus' patents set forth laws of nature-namely, relationships between concentrations of certain metabolites in the blood and the likelihood that a dosage of a thiopurine drug will prove ineffective or cause harm. Claim 1, for example, states that if the levels of 6-TG in the blood (of a patient who has taken a dose of a thiopurine drug) exceed about 400 pmol per 810^8 red blood cells, then the administered dose is likely to produce toxic side effects. While it takes a human action (the administration of a thiopurine drug) to trigger a manifestation of this relation in a particular person, the relation itself exists in principle apart from any human action. The relation is a consequence of the ways in which thiopurine compounds are metabolized by the bodyentirely natural processes. And so a patent that simply describes that relation sets forth a natural law.

The question before us is whether the claims do significantly more than simply describe these natural relations. To put the matter more precisely, do the patent claims add enough to their statements of the correlations to allow the processes they describe to qualify as patent-eligible processes that apply natural laws? We believe that the answer to this question is no.

## A

If a law of nature is not patentable, then neither is a process reciting a law of nature, unless that process has additional features that provide practical assurance that the process is more than a drafting effort designed to monopolize the law of nature itself. A patent, for example, could not simply recite a law of nature and then add the instruction "apply the law." Einstein, we assume, could not have patented his famous law by claiming a process consisting of simply telling linear accelerator operators to refer to the law to determine how much energy an amount of mass has produced (or vice versa). Nor could Archimedes have secured a patent for his famous principle of flotation by claiming a process consisting of simply telling boat builders to refer to that principle in order to determine whether an object will float.

What else is there in the claims before us? The process that each claim recites tells doctors interested in the subject about the correlations that the researchers discovered. In doing so, it recites an "administering" step, a "determining" step, and a "wherein" step. These additional steps are not themselves natural laws but neither are they sufficient to transform the nature of the claim.

First, the "administering" step simply refers to the relevant audience, namely doctors who treat patients with certain diseases with thiopurine drugs. That audience is a pre-existing audience; doctors used thiopurine drugs to treat patients suffering from autoimmune disorders long before anyone asserted these claims. In any event, the "prohibition against patenting abstract ideas 'cannot be circumvented by attempting to limit the use of the formula to a particular technological environment.'" Bilski, supra (quoting Diehr, 450 U.S., at 191-92).

Second, the "wherein" clauses simply tell a doctor about the relevant natural laws, at most adding a suggestion that he should take those laws into account when treating his patient. That is to say, these clauses tell the relevant audience about the laws while trusting them to use those laws appropriately where they are relevant to their decision making (rather like Einstein telling linear accelerator operators about his basic law and then trusting them to use it where relevant).

Third, the "determining" step tells the doctor to determine the level of the relevant metabolites in the blood, through whatever process the doctor or the laboratory wishes to use. As the patents state, methods for determining metabolite levels were well known in the art. ' 623 patent, col.9, 11.12-65, 2 App. 11. Indeed, scientists routinely measured metabolites as part of their investigations into the relationships between metabolite levels and efficacy and toxicity of thiopurine compounds. ' 623 patent, col.8, 11.37-40, id., at 10. Thus, this step tells doctors to engage in well-understood, routine, conventional activity previously engaged in by scientists who work in the field. Purely "conventional or obvious" "[pre]-solution activity" is normally not sufficient to transform an unpatentable law of nature into a patent-eligible application of such a law. Flook, 437 U.S., at 590; see also Bilski, 561 U.S. 610 ("[T]he prohibition against patenting abstract ideas 'cannot be circumvented by' . . . adding 'insignificant postsolution activity'" (quoting Diehr, supra, at 191-92)).

Fourth, to consider the three steps as an ordered combination adds nothing to the laws of nature that is not already present when the steps are considered separately. See Diehr, supra, at 188 ("[A] new combination of steps in a process may be patentable even though all the constituents of the combination were well known and in common use before the combination was made"). Anyone who wants to make use of these laws must first administer a thiopurine drug and measure the resulting metabolite concentrations, and so the combination amounts to nothing significantly more than an instruction to doctors to apply the applicable laws when treating their patients.

The upshot is that the three steps simply tell doctors to gather data from which they may draw an inference in light of the correlations. To put the matter more succinctly, the claims inform a relevant audience about certain laws of nature; any additional steps consist of well-understood, routine, conventional activity already engaged in by the scientific community; and those steps, when viewed as a whole, add nothing significant beyond the sum of their parts taken separately. For these reasons we believe that the steps are not sufficient to transform unpatentable natural correlations into patentable applications of those regularities.

A more detailed consideration of the controlling precedents reinforces our conclusion. The cases most directly on point are Diehr and Flook, two cases in which the Court reached opposite conclusions about the patent eligibility of processes that embodied the equivalent of natural laws. The Diehr process (held patent eligible) set forth a method for molding raw, uncured rubber into various cured, molded products. The process used a known mathematical equation, the Arrhenius equation, to determine when (depending upon the temperature inside the mold, the time the rubber had been in the mold, and the thickness of the rubber) to open the press.

The Court pointed out that the basic mathematical equation, like a law of nature, was not patentable. But it found the overall process patent eligible because of the way the additional steps of the process integrated the equation into the process as a whole. Those steps included "installing rubber in a press, closing the mold, constantly determining the temperature of the mold, constantly recalculating the appropriate cure time through the use of the formula and a digital computer, and automatically opening the press at the proper time." Id., at 187. It nowhere suggested that all these steps, or at least the combination of those steps, were in context obvious, already in use, or purely conventional. And so the patentees did not "seek to pre-empt the use of [the] equation," but sought "only to foreclose from others the use of that equation in conjunction with all of the other steps in their claimed process." Ibid. These other steps apparently added to the formula something that in terms of patent law's objectives had significance-they transformed the process into an inventive application of the formula.

The process in Flook (held not patentable) provided a method for adjusting "alarm limits" in the catalytic conversion of hydrocarbons. Certain operating conditions (such as temperature, pressure, and flow rates), which are continuously monitored during the conversion process, signal inefficiency or danger when they exceed certain "alarm limits." The claimed process amounted to an improved system for updating those alarm limits through the steps of: (1) measuring the current level of the variable, e.g., the temperature; (2) using an apparently novel mathematical algorithm to calculate the current alarm limits; and (3) adjusting the system to reflect the new alarm-limit values. 437 U.S., at 585-587.

The Court, as in Diehr, pointed out that the basic mathematical equation, like a law of nature, was not patentable. But it characterized the claimed process as doing nothing other than "provid[ing] a[n unpatentable] formula for computing an updated alarm limit." Flook, supra, at 586. Unlike the process in Diehr, it did not "explain how the variables used in the formula were to be selected, nor did the [claim] contain any disclosure relating to chemical processes at work or the means of setting off an alarm or adjusting the alarm limit." Diehr, supra, at 192, n. 14; see also Flook, 437 U.S., at 586. And so the other steps in the process did not limit the claim to a particular application. Moreover, " [t] he chemical processes involved in catalytic conversion of hydrocarbons[,] . . . the practice of monitoring the chemical process variables, the use of alarm limits to trigger alarms, the notion that alarm limit values must be recomputed and readjusted, and the use of computers for 'automatic monitoring-alarming'" were all "well known," to the point where, putting the formula to the side, there was no "inventive concept" in the claimed application of the formula. Id., at 594. "[P]ostsolution activity" that is purely "conventional or obvious," the Court wrote, "can[not] transform an unpatentable principle into a patentable process." Id., at 589, 590.

The claim before us presents a case for patentability that is weaker than the (patenteligible) claim in Diehr and no stronger than the (unpatentable) claim in Flook. Beyond picking out the relevant audience, namely those who administer doses of thiopurine drugs, the claim simply tells doctors to: (1) measure (somehow) the current level of the relevant metabolite, (2) use particular (unpatentable) laws of nature (which the claim sets forth) to calculate the current toxicity/inefficacy limits, and (3) reconsider the drug dosage in light of the law. These instructions add nothing specific to the laws of nature other than what is well-understood, routine, conventional activity, previously engaged in by those in the field. And since they are steps that must be taken in order to apply the laws in question, the effect is simply to tell doctors to apply the law somehow when treating their patients. The process in Diehr was not so characterized; that in Flook was characterized in roughly this way.

# 2 

Other cases offer further support for the view that simply appending conventional steps, specified at a high level of generality, to laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas cannot make those laws, phenomena, and ideas patentable. This Court has previously discussed in detail an English case, Neilson, which involved a patent claim that posed a legal problem very similar to the problem now before us. . . .
[There], the claimed process included not only a law of nature but also several unconventional steps (such as inserting the receptacle, applying heat to the receptacle externally, and blowing the air into the furnace) that confined the claims to a particular, useful application of the principle.

In Bilski the Court considered claims covering a process for hedging risks of price changes by, for example, contracting to purchase commodities from sellers at a fixed price, reflecting the desire of sellers to hedge against a drop in prices, while selling commodities to consumers at a fixed price, reflecting the desire of consumers to hedge against a price increase. One claim described the process; another reduced the process to a mathematical formula. The Court held that the described "concept of hedging" was "an unpatentable abstract idea." That some claims limited hedging to use in commodities and energy markets and specified that "well-known random analysis techniques [could be used] to help establish some of the inputs into the equation" did not undermine this conclusion, for "Flook established that limiting an abstract idea to one field of use or adding token postsolution components did not make the concept patentable."

Finally, in Benson the Court considered the patentability of a mathematical process for converting binary-coded decimal numerals into pure binary numbers on a general purpose digital computer. The claims "purported to cover any use of the claimed method in a general-purpose digital computer of any type." 409 U.S., at 64. The Court recognized that "a novel and useful structure created with the aid of knowledge of scientific truth'" might be patentable. Id., at 673 (quoting Mackay Radio, 306 U.S., at 94). But it held that simply implementing a mathematical principle on a physical machine, namely a computer, was not a patentable application of that principle. For the mathematical formula had "no substantial practical application except in connection with a digital computer." Benson, supra, at 71. Hence the claim (like the claims before us) was overly broad; it did not differ significantly from a claim that just said "apply the algorithm."

# 3 

The Court has repeatedly emphasized [the] concern that patent law not inhibit further discovery by improperly tying up the future use of laws of nature. Thus, in Morse the Court set aside as unpatentable Samuel Morse's general claim for "the use of the motive power of the electric or galvanic current ... however developed, for making or printing intelligible characters, letters, or signs, at any distances," 15 How., at 86. The Court explained:
"For aught that we now know some future inventor, in the onward march of science, may discover a mode of writing or printing at a distance by means of the electric or galvanic current, without using any part of the process or combination set forth in the plaintiff's specification. His invention may be less complicated-less liable to get out of order-less expensive in construction, and in its operation. But yet if it is covered by this patent the inventor could not use it, nor the public have the benefit of it without the permission of this patentee." Id., at 113.
Similarly, in Benson the Court said that the claims before it were "so abstract and sweeping as to cover both known and unknown uses of the [mathematical formula]." 409 U.S., at 67, 68. In Bilski the Court pointed out that to allow "petitioners to patent risk hedging would pre-empt use of this approach in all fields." And in Flook the Court expressed concern that the claimed process was simply "a formula for computing an updated alarm limit," which might "cover a broad range of potential uses." 437 U.S., at 586 .

These statements reflect that, even though rewarding with patents those who discover new laws of nature and the like might well encourage their discovery, those laws and principles, considered generally, are "the basic tools of scientific and technological work." Benson, supra, at 67. And so there is a danger that the grant of patents that tic up their use will inhibit future innovation premised upon them, a danger that becomes acute when a patented process amounts to no more than an instruction to "apply the natural law," or otherwise forecloses more future invention than the underlying discovery could reasonably justify. See generally Lemley, Risch, Sichelman, \& Wagner, Life After Bilski, 63 Stan. L. Rev. 1315 (2011) (hereinafter Lemley) (arguing that §101 reflects this kind of concern); see also C. Bohannan \& H. Hovenkamp, Creation without Restraint: Promoting Liberty and Rivalry in INNOVATION 112 (2012) ("One problem with [process] patents is that the more abstractly their claims are stated, the more difficult it is to determine precisely what they cover. They risk being applied to a wide range of situations that were not anticipated by the patentee"); W. Landes \& R. Posner, The Economic Structure of InTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAW 305-06 (2003) (The exclusion from patent law of basic truths reflects "both . . . the enormous potential for rent secking that would be created if property rights could be obtained in them and . . . the enormous transaction costs that would be imposed on would-be users [of those truths].").

The laws of nature at issue here are narrow laws that may have limited applications, but the patent claims that embody them nonetheless implicate this concern. They tell a treating doctor to measure metabolite levels and to consider the resulting measurements in light of the statistical relationships they describe. In doing so, they tie up the doctor's subsequent treatment decision whether that treatment does, or does not, change in light of the inference he has drawn using the correlations. And they threaten to inhibit the development of more refined treatment recommendations (like that embodied in Mayo's test), that combine Prometheus' correlations with later discovered features of metabolites, human physiology or individual patient characteristics. The "determining" step too is set forth in highly general language covering all processes that make use of the correlations after measuring metabolites, including later discovered processes that measure metabolite levels in new ways.

We need not, and do not, now decide whether were the steps at issue here less conventional, these features of the claims would prove sufficient to invalidate them. For here, as we have said, the steps add nothing of significance to the natural laws themselves. Unlike, say, a typical patent on a new drug or a new way of using an existing drug, the patent claims do not confine their reach to particular applications of those laws. The presence here of the basic underlying concern that these patents tie up too much future use of laws of nature simply reinforces our conclusion that the processes described in the patents are not patent eligible, while eliminating any temptation to depart from case law precedent.
We have considered several further arguments in support of Prometheus' position. But they do not lead us to adopt a different conclusion. First, the Federal Circuit, in upholding the patent eligibility of the claims before us, relied on this Court's determination that "[t]ransformation and reduction of an article 'to a different state or thing' is the clue to the patentability of a process claim that does not include particular machines." Benson, supra, at 70-71 (emphasis added). It reasoned that the claimed processes are therefore patent eligible, since they involve transforming the human body by administering a thiopurine drug and transforming the blood by analyzing it to determine metabolite levels. 628 F.3d, at 1356-1357.

The first of these transformations, however, is irrelevant. As we have pointed out, the "administering" step simply helps to pick out the group of individuals who are likely interested in applying the law of nature. And the second step could be satisfied without transforming the blood, should science develop a totally different system for determining metabolite levels that did not involve such a transformation. Regardless, in stating that the "machine-or-transformation" test is an "important and useful clue" to patentability, we have neither said nor implied that the test trumps the "law of nature" exclusion. Bilski, 561 U.S., at 601-03 (emphasis added). That being so, the test fails here.

Second, Prometheus argues that, because the particular laws of nature that its patent claims embody are narrow and specific, the patents should be upheld. Thus, it encourages us to draw distinctions among laws of nature based on whether or not they will interfere significantly with innovation in other fields now or in the future. Brief for Respondent 42-46; see also Lemley 1342-1344 (making similar argument).

But the underlying functional concern here is a relative one: how much future innovation is foreclosed relative to the contribution of the inventor. A patent upon a narrow law of nature may not inhibit future research as seriously as would a patent upon Einstein's law of relativity, but the creative value of the discovery is also considerably smaller. And, as we have previously pointed out, even a narrow law of nature (such as the one before us) can inhibit future research.

In any event, our cases have not distinguished among different laws of nature according to whether or not the principles they embody are sufficiently narrow. See, e.g., Flook, 437 U.S. 584 (holding narrow mathematical formula unpatentable). And this is understandable. Courts and judges are not institutionally well suited to making the kinds of judgments needed to distinguish among different laws of nature. And so the cases have endorsed a bright-line prohibition against patenting laws of nature, mathematical formulas and the like, which serves as a somewhat more easily administered proxy for the underlying "building-block" concern.

Third, the Government argues that virtually any step beyond a statement of a law of nature itself should transform an unpatentable law of nature into a potentially patentable application sufficient to satisfy §101 's demands. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae. The Government does not necessarily believe that claims that (like the claims before us) extend just minimally beyond a law of nature should receive patents. But in its view, other statutory provisions-those that insist that a claimed process be novel, 35 U.S.C. §102, that it not be "obvious in light of prior art," §103, and that it be "full[y], clear[ly], concise[ly], and exact[ly]" described, §112-can perform this screening function. In particular, it argues that these claims likely fail for lack of novelty under §102.

This approach, however, would make the "law of nature" exception to §101 patentability a dead letter. The approach is therefore not consistent with prior law. The relevant cases rest their holdings upon section 101, not later sections.

We recognize that, in evaluating the significance of additional steps, the §101 patent-eligibility inquiry and, say, the §102 novelty inquiry might sometimes overlap. But that need not always be so. And to shift the patent-eligibility inquiry entirely to these later sections risks creating significantly greater legal uncertainty, while assuming that those sections can do work that they are not equipped to do.

What role would laws of nature, including newly discovered (and "novel") laws of nature, play in the Government's suggested "novelty" inquiry? Intuitively, one would suppose that a newly discovered law of nature is novel. The Government, however, suggests in effect that the novelty of a component law of nature may be disregarded when evaluating the novelty of the whole. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 27. But §§102 and 103 say nothing about treating laws of nature as if they were part of the prior art when applying those sections. Cf. Diehr, 450 U.S., at 188 (patent claims "must be considered as a whole"). And studiously ignoring all laws of nature when evaluating a patent application under §§102 and 103 would "make all inventions unpatentable because all inventions can be reduced to underlying principles of nature which, once known, make their implementation obvious." Id., at 189, n. 12. See also Eisenberg, Wisdom of the Ages or Dead-Hand Control? Patentable Subject Matter for Diagnostic Methods After In re Bilski, 3 CASE W. RES. J.L. TECH. \& INTERNET 1, [6263] (2012).

Section 112 requires only a "written description of the invention . . . in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the same." It does not focus on the possibility that a law of nature (or its equivalent) that meets the[] [disclosure] conditions will nonetheless create [a] risk that a patent on the law would significantly impede future innovation.

These considerations lead us to decline the Government's invitation to substitute §§102,103, and 112 inquiries for the better established inquiry under §101.

Fourth, Prometheus, supported by several amici, argues that a principle of law denying patent coverage here will interfere significantly with the ability of medical researchers to make valuable discoveries, particularly in the area of diagnostic research. That research, which includes research leading to the discovery of laws of nature, is expensive; it "ha[s] made the United States the world leader in this field"; and it requires protection. Brief for Respondent 52.

Other medical experts, however, argue strongly against a legal rule that would make the present claims patent eligible, invoking policy considerations that point in the opposite direction. [Various medical organizations] tell us that if "claims to exclusive rights over the body's natural responses to illness and medical treatment are permitted to stand, the result will be a vast thicket of exclusive rights over the use of critical scientific data that must remain widely available if physicians are to provide sound medical care." Brief for American College of Medical Genetics et al. as Amici Curiae 7.

We do not find this kind of difference of opinion surprising. Patent protection is, after all, a two-edged sword. On the one hand, the promise of exclusive rights provides monetary incentives that lead to creation, invention, and discovery. On the other hand, that very exclusivity can impede the flow of information that might permit, indeed spur, invention, by, for example, raising the price of using the patented ideas once created, requiring potential users to conduct costly and time-consuming searches of existing patents and pending patent applications, and requiring the negotiation of complex licensing arrangements. . . .

For these reasons, we conclude that the patent claims at issue here effectively claim the underlying laws of nature themselves. The claims are consequently invalid. And the Federal Circuit's judgment is reversed.

# COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS 

1. The Supreme Court summarized the representative patent claim at issue as comprising three components: (1) an administering step; (2) a determining step; and (3) a wherein clause. The Court declares that "to transform an unpatentable law of nature into a patent-eligible application of such a law, one must do more than simply state the law of nature while adding the words 'apply it.'" Could the patentee have cured its eligibility problem by claiming that the thiopurine dosage be modified based on the blood chemistry change, rather than merely "indicating" a change in the "wherein" clause? Would that have changed the claim from being merely a glorified observation of a natural fact into a true process that leads to actions that cause some effects? Why might the patentee have claimed its invention in such an oblique way?

In Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. West-Ward Pharmaceuticals, 887 F.3d 1117 (Fed. Cir. 2018), the Federal Circuit upheld the validity of a method for treating schizophrenia that, much like the claim in Mayo, based the dosage of a drug on how a patient metabolized the drug. The court distinguished Mayo on the ground that the claims there "were not directed to a novel method of treating a disease . . . but rather to a diagnostic method based on the 'relationships between concentrations of certain metabolites in the blood and the likelihood that a dosage of a thiopurine drug will prove ineffective or cause harm." Id. at 1134. The court emphasized that the representative claim in Mayo "was not directed to the application of a drug to treat a particular disease." Id. (emphasis added). By contrast, the claims at issue in Vanda are "directed to a method of using iloperidone to treat schizophrenia." Id. at 1135. The court noted that the inventors did not claim the relationship between the drug and its metabolization in the body, but rather "an application of that relationship." Thus, the claims are "a new way of using an existing drug' that is safer for patients because it reduces [a particular] risk."
Id. at 1135 (quoting Mayo). Chief Judge Prost dissented, explaining that the claimed invention "is no more than an optimization of an existing treatment of schizophrenia, just as the claims in Mayo concerned 'optimizing therapeutic efficacy' of thiopurine drugs." Id. at 1142 (Prost, C.J., dissenting). She noted that "Mayo warned against 'drafting effort[s] designed to monopolize the law of nature itself.'" Id.
2. Inventive Application. The decision revives the inventive application framework set forth in Flook, a test that appeared to have been overridden by Diehr. In so doing, the Court based the decision, as it did in Flook, on Neilson v. Harford, stating that "the claimed process [in Neilson] included not only a law of nature but also several unconventional steps (such as inserting the receptacle, applying heat to the receptacle externally, and blowing the air into the furnace) that confined the claims to a particular, useful application of the principle." (Emphasis added.) Did the Mayo Court interpret Neilson (and Morse's interpretation of Neilson) correctly? What is unconventional about inserting a receptacle, applying heat to the receptacle externally, and blowing air into the furnace? The Court of Exchequer considered Neilson's application of discovery (preheating air prior to injection into the furnace) to be "perfectly well known." Neilson v. Harford, 1 Web. P. C. 295, 344 (1841).

So why would Baron Parke have said "[w]e think the case must be considered as if the principle being well known"? Professor Jeffrey Lefstin contends that the answer lies in the prior sentence: "we think that the plaintiff does not merely claim a principle, but a machine embodying a principle, and a very valuable one." The Court of Exchequer was drawing an analogy to Minter v. Wells, Carpmael's Patent Cases 622 (1834), which held that a broad claim to a reclining chair embodying a well-known scientific principle (the self-adjusting leverage) was drawn to a machine as opposed to merely claiming a principle of mechanics in the abstract. The Neilson decision was merely postulating a counter-factual scenario so as to analogize to Minter. The Exchequer concluded that Neilson's claim, like Minter's, was to a machine and not merely an abstract scientific principle. Neilson's discovery, that preheating air before injecting into a blast furnace would improve combustion over the prior art (injecting unheated air), was in fact new. See Jeffrey A. Lefstin, Inventive Application: A History, 67 Fla. L. Rev. 565, 581-87 (2015) (arguing that both Flook and Mayo based the inventive application requirement on a profound misunderstanding of the Neilson case).
3. How does §101 patentable subject matter eligibility analysis compare with §103 nonobviousness analysis? How does determination of whether application of a law of nature is "well-understood, routine, conventional" compare with whether "the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains"?
4. Inventions and Discoveries. Art. I, §8, Cl. 8 of the U.S. Constitution grants Congress power to establish patent protection for "Discoveries." U.S. patent law has, since its inception in 1790, authorized the granting of patents for "inventions and discoveries," The Senate Report accompanying the Patent Act of 1836 leaves no doubt that Congress fully intended patent protection for practical applications of scientific discoveries:

Whoever imagines that, because so many inventions and so many improvements in machinery have been made, there remains little else to be discovered, has but a feeble conception of the infinitude and vastness of mechanical powers, or of the unlimited reach of science. Much as has been discovered, infinitely more remains unrevealed. The ingenuity of man is exploring a region without limits, and delving in a mine whose treasures are exhaustless. 'Neither are all the mysteries of nature unfolded, nor the mind tired in the pursuit of them.'

The first conceptions of ingenuity, like the first suggestions of science, are theorics which require something of experiment and practical exemplification to perfect. . . .
Senate Report Accompanying Senate Bill No. 239, 24th Cong., 1st Sess. (Apr. 28, 1836) (emphasis added). But what about protection for the scientific discovery itself? The 1952 Patent Act defines "invention" to mean "invention or discovery." §100 (a). Does the judicially-established inventive application standard override legislative intent as reflected in the text of the patent acts? Under Mayo, are conventional applications of new discoveries patentable? The discoveries themselves? Professor Sean O'Connor contends that "discovery" in 1790 meant an important invention, not what it means today: the identification of an idea or scientific principle. See Sean O'Connor, The Overlooked French Influence on the Intellectual Property Clause, 82 U. CHI. L. REV. 733 (2015).
5. What does the Supreme Court mean by a "law of nature"? Is a mathematical algorithm the same as the relationship between blood-borne drug (or metabolite) levels and the efficacy of the drug? Is a formula such as the one in Flook the product of observation, such as the correlation in Mayo? Do mathematical relationships exist "in nature" where engineers and mathematicians discover them, or are they human creations? A more apt description of what the Court has in mind may be "facts about the world." The optimal metabolic level of thiopurine in the human body isn't a "law of nature" in a classical sense. But it is a fact to be discovered, not invented. That seems enough to bring it within the ambit of Mayo.

As for the algorithms in cases such as Flook, there is a longstanding tradition that sees mathematical relationships as preexisting facts about the world that are merely discovered, rather than invented. See Platonism in the Philosophy of Mathematics, Stanford ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHILOSOPHY, http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism-mathematics/. On the other hand, there is an alternative tradition that sees mathematics as a very useful set of descriptive aids that are more properly described as inventions rather than pre-existing truths. See Mark Balaguer, Platonism and Anti-Platonism in Mathematics (2001). In any event, computer software code can hardly be described as pure mathematics-it is written in a complex, human-invented programming language that is used to solve real-world problems. It would surprise most coders to be told that the complex piece of programming they worked on for three months was merely "discovered"!

One author has suggested that there are actually three types of "abstract ideas" under the Court's current cases:

- "laws of nature as such." This was what was at issue in cases like Neilson, and includes Mayo's focus on facts about the world.
- mental steps and economic activity such as business methods and calculations that can be done in the human mind, even if they are in fact performed using a computer.
- functional claims to the results of using known machinery, as opposed to the actual process or means of producing those results.
Joseph Matal, The Three Types of Abstract Ideas, 30 FED. CIR. B.J. 87 (2021). The Court's use of the term "abstract ideas" or "laws of nature" to refer to these very different concepts may help explain some of the doctrinal confusion in this area. Professor Chin contends that these §101 cases are really about distinguishing between reproducible empirical findings (in keeping with the scientific tradition associated with philosopher David Hume) and purely theoretical ("a priori") scientific concepts. See Andrew Chin, The Epistemological Function of the Patent Document, 99 Tulane L. REV. (forthcoming 2025).

6. The Alice Decision. In Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International, 573 U.S. 208 (2014), the Supreme Court addressed patent claims reminiscent of those at issue in Bilski. A representative claim stated:

A method of exchanging obligations as between partics, each party holding a credit record and a debit record with an exchange institution, the credit records and debit records for exchange of predetermined obligations, the method comprising the steps of:
(a) creating a shadow credit record and a shadow debit record for each stakeholder party to be held independently by a supervisory institution from the exchange institutions;
(b) obtaining from each exchange institution a start-of-day balance for each shadow credit record and shadow debit record;
(c) for every transaction resulting in an exchange obligation, the supervisory institution adjusting each respective party's shadow credit record or shadow debit record, allowing only these transactions that do not result in the value of the shadow debit record being less than the value of the shadow credit record at any time, each said adjustment taking place in chronological order, and (d) at the end-of-day, the supervisory institution instructing on[e] of the exchange institutions to exchange credits or debits to the credit record and debit record of the respective partics in accordance with the adjustments of the said permitted transactions, the credits and debits being irrevocable, time invariant obligations placed on the exchange institutions.
U.S. Patent No. 5,970,479, Claim 33. The en banc Federal Circuit divided 5-5 on the interpretation of Bilski and Mayo. Writing for a unanimous Supreme Court, Justice Thomas reaffirmed the inventive application approach revived in Mayo. The decision characterized Mayo as a two-step inquiry:

Step 1: Is the patent "directed to" a patent-ineligible law of nature, natural phenomena, or abstract idea?
Step 2: If so, does the claim contain an inventive concept sufficient to transform the ineligible law of nature, natural phenomena, or abstract idea into a patenteligible application of the ineligible subject matter?
The Alice decision characterized step two of this analysis as a search for an "inventive concept"-i.e., an element or combination of elements that is "sufficient to ensure that the patent in practice amounts to significantly more than a patent upon the [ineligible concept] itself." Id. at 218. Applying this framework, the Court concluded that the representative method claim does no more than implement the abstract idea of intermediated settlement on a generic computer and that the system and media claims add nothing of substance to the underlying abstract idea. Id. at 217-27. Echoing Justice Stevens' concurrence in Bilski, Justice Sotomayor, joined by Justices Ginsburg and Breyer, concurred in the holding based on the view that business methods do not qualify as a "process" under §101. Id. at 227; see Peter S. Menell, Forty Years of Wondering in the Wilderness and No Closer to the Promised Land: Bilski's Superficial Textualism and the Missed Opportunity to Return Patent Law to its Technology Mooring, 63 STAN. L. REV. 1289 (2011).
7. Implementing the Mayo/Alice Framework. The two-step Alice test has become the definitive test for patentable subject matter since 2014. Lower courts have struggled to apply the Supreme Court's decisions. See DDR Holdings, LLC v. Hotels.com, L.P., 773 F.3d 1245 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (emphasizing under step 1 that the claim is "rooted in the computer technology" and hence not abstract; and basing step 2 analysis on a bald assertion that the claimed invention is "not merely the routine or conventional use of the Internet" without discussion of prior art); Ultramercial, Inc. v. Hulu, LLC, 772 F.3d 709, 715 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (noting that "[a]s the Court stated in Alice, '[a]t some level, "all inventions ... embody, use, reflect, rest upon, or apply laws of nature, natural phenomena, or abstract ideas"). That said, empirical evidence suggests that lawyers and courts have become pretty good at predicting whether a patent claim will survive an Alice challenge. See Nikola L. Datzov \& Jason Rantanen, Predictable Unpredictability: The Surprising Administrability of Patent Subject Matter Eligibility, 110 Iowa L. Rev. 667 (2025).

Between 2014 and the end of 2017, district courts invalidated over 300 patents on §101 grounds. By contrast, courts invalidated fewer than 30 patents on §101 grounds over the prior decade. The Federal Circuit in particular invalidated more than 90% of the claims that reached it on §101 grounds between 2014 and 2019. But patentees have been gaining ground over time; the share of patentee wins is steadily increasing. See Mark A. Lemley \& Samantha Zyontz, Does Alice Target Patent Trolls?, 18 J. EMPIRICAL LEGAL STUD. 47 (2021).

Mayo and Alice have had a substantial effect on Patent Office rejections, but only in some fields:
![img-11.jpeg](img-11.jpeg)
8. Procedure. In the wake of Alice, district courts began to invalidate patent claims at the pleading (FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6) and 12(c)) and summary judgment stages, often without construing the claims. One rationale for addressing §101 invalidity contentions at an early stage of litigation is to afford courts a quick way to screen out weak patents, particularly abstract business method patents issued prior to the Supreme Court's Bilski, Mayo, and Alice decisions.

In a stark shift, the Federal Circuit ruled in 2018 that " [t] he question of whether a claim element or combination of elements is well-understood, routine and conventional to a skilled artisan in the relevant field is a question of fact" and hence is not amenable to summary adjudication unless there is no genuine disputed issue. See Berkheimer v. HP Inc., 881 F.3d 1360, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2018). Moreover, "[t]he mere fact that something is disclosed in a piece of prior art . . . does not mean it was well-understood, routine, and conventional." Id. at 1369. Furthermore, the Federal Circuit intimated in Aatrix Software v. Green Shades Software, 882 F.3d 1121, 1128, 1130 (Fed. Cir. 2018), that claim construction might be necessary in resolving whether a claim is invalid under §101.

The Federal Circuit's Berkheimer and Aatrix decisions patents make it harder to invalidate patents on §101 grounds early in a case. Are there other relatively efficient ways to dispose of unmeritorious cases? Perhaps. Moreover, the new administrative review procedures available under the AIA provide an additional avenue. See Chapter III(D). But patentable subject matter is a question of law, while most other invalidity doctrines are factual or mixed questions of law and fact, meaning that it is much harder to resolve them early in a case. That might be a good thing. See Dennis D. Crouch \& Robert P. Merges, Operating Efficiently Post-Bilski by Ordering Patent Doctrine Decision-Making, 25 BERKELEY TECH. L.J. 1673 (2010) (arguing that §101 should be used only as a last resort). But it may also mean that plaintiffs with weak patents can coerce a settlement by pointing to the cost and uncertainty of litigation.

The policy question is whether changing §101, thereby increasing the cost of weeding out bad patents early in litigation, is worth the cost. Making §103 summary judgment the earliest occasion for eliminating weak patents adds settlement leverage for patent owners; letting them get to trial adds even more. That needs to be balanced against any extra cost incurred in applying the Mayo-Alice §101 test in cases in which no §101 analysis would have been necessary under the pre-Mayo/Alice cases, or would be necessary under a newly revised §101. Mayo/Alice added a §101 issue to many cases, adding to the cost of liitgation. Under the current test, some patent owners must defend a FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6) motion that would not have been made under the old law. On the other hand, many patents that face a §101 challenge are invalidated on that ground. Does that suggest that the law is an efficient way to weed out weak claims?
9. Preemption Rationale. How does §101 patentable subject matter eligibility analysis compare with the §112 (a) written description requirement? Citing Morse, the Mayo Court emphasizes that its limits on patent eligibility are based on concerns about preempting the use of a natural law, i.e., conferring overbroad monopoly power and interfering with cumulative creativity. Is Morse better understood as a case about overbroad claiming-the specification did not support a claim to all methods of communicating at a distance using electromagnetism-or about the abstract nature of Morse's audacious eighth claim? In Dolbear v. Am. Bell Tel. Co., 126 U.S. 1, 535 (1888), the Supreme Court explained that an inventor's claim might practically preempt all of a discovery. Such breadth would "show []the great importance of [the] discovery, but it will not invalidate [the] patent." Does §112 provide sufficient tools for ensuring that patents do not extend beyond their proper scope? Or is there room for patentable subject matter to police patent overreaching? See Mark A. Lemley, et al., Life After Bilski, 63 STAN. L. REV. 1315 (2011) (arguing that the proper role for patentable subject matter is in policing overbreadth).

Recall Justice Frankfurter's concurrence in Funk Brothers that introducing "such terms as 'the work of nature' and the 'laws of nature'" only confuse the issue as "[a]rguments drawn from such terms for ascertaining patentability could fairly be employed to challenge almost every patent." 333 U.S. at 134-35.

How are patentees, the PTO, and lower courts to make sense of the inventive application doctrine? Aren't most innovations in the burgeoning field of personalized medicine-the determination of correlations between an individual's genetic makeup and the probabilities of his or her responsiveness to particular treatments such as chemotherapy-likely to fall within the "law of nature" exclusion? Is the Court suggesting that such application of breakthrough scientific discoveries-even though potentially life-saving and worthy of a Nobel Prize-are unpatentable because they risk "inhibit[ing] further discovery by improperly tying up the future use of laws of nature"? Wouldn't it better, as Justice Frankfurter suggested in his Funk Bros. concurrence, to address the preemption concern by policing claim breadth? Can §112 serve that purpose? How would a §112 challenge have fared in Mayo?

Subsequent decisions have made clear that while preemption is the concern that motivates the patentable subject matter cases, the legal test is not whether a law of nature or an abstract idea is preempted. Rather, the two-part Mayo-Alice test is the definitive test for all patentable subject matter inquiries. See Ariosa Diagnostics, Inc. v. Sequenom, Inc., 788 F.3d 1371, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2015).
10. Patent Policy and Promoting Advances in Personalized Medicine. Is Mayo good patent policy? Is it good health care policy? On what does your answer depend? The cost of personalized medicine research? The riskiness of personalized medicine research? The extent to which it constrains medical practitioners and downstream innovators? Suppose that the costs of collecting and evaluating DNA, which are falling precipitously, drive the cost of personalized medicine research. Does that affect your view?

Suppose Congress were to decide that the determination of novel and non-obvious correlations between known drug treatments and individual responsiveness based on molecular biology research merited patent protection. Similarly, suppose Congress were to decide that the determination of novel and non-obvious algorithms merited patent protection. Could Congress amend §101 to include the following: "Applications of newly discovered laws of nature and algorithms shall be eligible for patent protection so long as the claimed invention is new, non-obvious, and useful when viewed as a whole." Would such an approach effectively eliminate the patentable subject matter inquiry? How would the claims in Alice and Mayo fare under that test?
11. Medical and Surgical Procedure Patents and Political Economy. In 1992, Dr. Samuel L. Pallin obtained U.S. Patent No. 5,080,111 on a method of making self-scaling incisions as part of cataract surgery. Prior to this patent, medical professionals did not generally seek patents on surgical procedures. After word of this patent spread, the American Medical Association ("AMA") unanimously adopted a resolution at its 1994 Annual Meeting "vigorously condemn[ing] the patenting of medical and surgical procedures and [vowing to] work with Congress to outlaw this practice." The uproar increased after Dr. Pallin sued another doctor for infringement. See Pallin v. Singer, 36 U.S.P.Q.2d 1050 (D. Vt. 1995). A broad coalition of medical associations successfully enlisted several legislators with medical backgrounds to block such patents. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, in conjunction with patent law associations, vigorously opposed any effort to restrict patent eligibility. The ultimate compromise left §101 unchanged. Instead, Congress added §287 (c), which bars infringement actions against any medical practitioner or a related health care entity. The provision does not, however, bar lawsuits against makers of devices specially designed to infringe a medical procedure patent. See §271(c) (contributory infringement). As noted earlier, an analogous compromise led to the establishment of a prior user right for methods of doing business following the Federal Circuit's State Street Bank decision opening the way for business method patents. The political economy surrounding reforming patentable subject matter (and patent law more generally) is complicated by entrenched interests.

# iii. Patenting of Molecular Biology/Biotechnology 

Path-breaking discoveries in the field of genetic engineering have posed substantial challenges for patent eligibility. As noted earlier, the Supreme Court held in Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303 (1980), that newly invented genetically modified organisms were patentable.

But this precedent did not resolve the question of whether isolated sequences of DNA are patentable. Since the late 19^th century, following Gregor Mendel's discovery of the basic principles of heredity from plant experiments and Swiss physician Friedrich Miescher's discovery of a microscopic substance in the pus of discarded surgical bandages, scientists have suspected that chemical compounds in the nuclei of cells played a role in human biology. In 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick proposed the double-helix model of DNA structure. Within a few years, they and others had begun to unravel the relationship among DNA, RNA, and proteins that form the foundation of molecular biology.

Although this early basic research was not patented, methods for combining and replicating DNA were. Stanford University and the University of California patented the first gene splicing methods, invented by Professors Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer, in the early 1970s and licensed them broadly, earning more than $200 million for the universities. Boyer would go on to co-found Genentech, which became a major biotechnology company. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique for amplifying a single copy of a piece of DNA, invented by Dr. Kary Mullis of Cetus Corporation was patented in the late 1980s, see U.S. Patent Nos. 4,683,202, 4,683,195, 4,965,188. It greatly expanded biotechnology research. These method patents fit well within the mold of traditional scientific process inventions and did not encounter serious patentable subject matter eligibility challenges.

The use of these and other techniques to map the human (and other) genomes and isolate regions of the DNA structure associated with particular traits and disease propensities generated significant controversy over the patenting of natural substances and life. Could scientists patent particular, isolated, naturally-occurring sequences of DNA?
To appreciate this question, we need to examine carlier jurisprudence relating to claims to isolated natural substances. In American Wood-Paper Co. v. The Fibre Disintegrating Co., 90 U.S. ( 23 Wall.) 566 (1874), the patentee claimed "as a new article of manufacture" "a pulp suitable for the manufacture of paper, made from wood or other vegetable substances, by boiling the wood or other vegetable substance in an alkali under pressure, substantially as described." In essence, the patentee sought to patent the cellulose product (and not just the process) of a paper production technology. The Supreme Court rejected the claim, noting that "There are many things well known and valuable in medicine or in the arts which may be extracted from divers[e] substances. But the extract is the same, no matter from what it has been taken. A process to obtain it from a subject from which it has never been taken may be the creature of invention, but the thing itself when obtained cannot be called a new manufacture." Id. at 593-94.

Notwithstanding (and apparently unaware of) this decision, Judge Learned Hand issued a highly influential decision several decades later upholding a claim to purified adrenaline. See Parke-Davis \& Co. v. H.K. Mulford \& Co., 189 F. 95 (C.C.S.D.N.Y. 1911) (Hand, J.), aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 196 F. 496 (2d Cir. 1912); Linda J. Demaine \& Aaron Xavier Fellmeth, Reinventing the Double Helix: A Novel and Nonobvious Reconceptualization of the Biotechnology Patent, 55 STAN. L. REV. 303, 334-39 (2002). Judge Hand established a pragmatic test: "Takamine was the first to make [purified adrenaline] available for any use by removing it from the other gland-tissue.... [I]t became for every practical purpose a new thing commercially and therapeutically." 189 F. at 102-03.

With the advances in biotechnology following Watson and Crick's path-breaking discoveries, mapping the human genome became a realistic goal by the mid-1980s. In 1988, Congress funded the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to undertake the Human Genome Project. A private company also entered the competition, which quickly led to the filing of patent claims on sequences of cDNA called expressed sequence tags (ESTs). After reviewing the patent jurisprudence, the PTO issued a series of guidelines essentially following Judge Hand's approach. In its 2001 Utility Examination Guidelines, the PTO explained:

An inventor can patent a discovery when the patent application satisfies the statutory requirements. The U.S. Constitution uses the word 'discoveries' where it authorizes Congress to promote progress made by inventors. . . .
... Thus, an inventor's discovery of a gene can be the basis for a patent on the genetic composition isolated from its natural state and processed through purifying steps that separate the gene from other molecules naturally associated with it.
PTO, Utility Examination Guidelines, 66 Fed. Reg. 1092, 1092-93 (Jan. 5, 2001) (citing Parke-Davis and a patent issued to Louis Pasteur on a yeast used in beer brewing, U.S. Patent No. 141,072 (1873)). Patenting of isolated genetic compounds quickly took off, with the principal focus on the utility requirement, which we covered in Chapter III(B)(3).
The patentable subject matter question, however, was simmering and would come to a boil over a decade later over the patenting of genes associated with breast and ovarian cancer. In the early 1990s human gene discovery was incredibly challenging. The human genome contains about 3 billion nucleotides and the average gene contains about 10,000-15,000 nucleotides making the search for a specific gene without a map akin to finding a needle in the haystack.

In 1990, a UC Berkeley team led by Professor Mary-Claire King made the first major step towards identifying the breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) gene by using linkage analysis ^11 to locate BRCA1 to a 22 -million nucleotide region on chromosome 17. See Mary-Claire King. "The Race" to Clone BRCA1, 343 SCIENCE 1462 (Mar. 28, 2014).

This region was too large to directly sequence or clone but set off a race between competing teams of scientists to pinpoint the exact location and sequence of BRCA1. Mark Skolnick, a population geneticist, assembled a team and co-founded Myriad Genetics to discover the BRCA1 gene. Myriad had two key advantages-strong ability to raise capital to undertake this labor-intensive work and access to the Utah Cancer registry and an extensive database of Mormon pedigrees living in Utah. These factors led Myriad to pinpoint the BRCA1 gene to a 600,000-nucleotide region, which was small enough for physical mapping. Myriad used several positional cloning strategies to map this region using libraries of random human genomic DNA fragments and cDNA. But others, including King, were also racing to sequence the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. In 1994, Myriad discovered the precise location of BRCA1, the BRCA1 cDNA sequence, and a partial sequence of BRCA1 genomic DNA. Myriad subsequently filed a patent containing composition and method claims stemming from this discovery including isolated DNA claims. A competing company, Oncor, also filed patents on the BRCA1 gene, and the two sued each other for infringement. Myriad published the gene sequence for BRCA2 in 1995, just one day before a competing group published partial sequence data for the same gene. See E. Richard Gold \& Julia Carbone, Myriad Genetics: In the Eye of the Policy Storm, 12 GENET. MED. S39 (2010).

After over a decade of patients paying thousands of dollars to use Myriad's test for the gene, the Association for Molecular Pathology, a consortium of individuals from academic and community medical centers, government, and industry, challenged the patentability of DNA compounds.

Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc. Supreme Court of the United States 569 U.S. 576 (2013)

THOMAS, J.

Respondent Myriad Genetics, Inc. (Myriad), discovered the precise location and sequence of two human genes, mutations of which can substantially increase the risks of breast and ovarian cancer. Myriad obtained a number of patents based upon its discovery. This case involves claims from three of them and requires us to resolve whether a naturally occurring segment of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is patent eligible under 35 U.S.C. §101 by virtue of its isolation from the rest of the human genome. We also address the patent eligibility of synthetically created DNA known as complementary DNA (cDNA), which contains the same protein-coding information found in a segment of natural DNA but omits portions within the DNA segment that do not code for proteins. For the reasons that follow, we hold that a naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature and not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated, but that cDNA is patent eligible because it is not naturally occurring. We, therefore, affirm in part and reverse in part the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

Genes form the basis for hereditary traits in living organisms. The human genome consists of approximately 22,000 genes packed into 23 pairs of chromosomes. Each gene is encoded as DNA, which takes the shape of the familiar "double helix" that Doctors James Watson and Francis Crick first described in 1953. Each "cross-bar" in the DNA helix consists of two chemically joined nucleotides. The possible nucleotides are adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G), each of which binds naturally with another nucleotide: A pairs with T; C pairs with G. The nucleotide cross-bars are chemically connected to a sugar-phosphate backbone that forms the outside framework of the DNA helix. Sequences of DNA nucleotides contain the information necessary to create strings of amino acids, which in turn are used in the body to build proteins. Only some DNA nucleotides, however, code for amino acids; these nucleotides are known as "exons." Nucleotides that do not code for amino acids, in contrast, are known as "introns."

Creation of proteins from DNA involves two principal steps, known as transcription and translation. In transcription, the bonds between DNA nucleotides separate, and the DNA helix unwinds into two single strands. A single strand is used as a template to create a complementary ribonucleic acid (RNA) strand. The nucleotides on the DNA strand pair naturally with their counterparts, with the exception that RNA uses the nucleotide base uracil (U) instead of thymine (T). Transcription results in a single strand RNA molecule, known as pre-RNA, whose nucleotides form an inverse image of the DNA strand from which it was created. Pre-RNA still contains nucleotides corresponding to both the exons and introns in the DNA molecule. The pre-RNA is then naturally "spliced" by the physical removal of the introns. The resulting product is a strand of RNA that contains nucleotides corresponding only to the exons from the original DNA strand. The exons-only strand is known as messenger RNA (mRNA), which creates amino acids through translation. In translation, cellular structures known as ribosomes read each set of three nucleotides, known as codons, in the mRNA. Each codon either tells the ribosomes which of the 20 possible amino acids to synthesize or provides a stop signal that ends amino acid production.

DNA's informational sequences and the processes that create mRNA, amino acids, and proteins occur naturally within cells. Scientists can, however, extract DNA from cells using well known laboratory methods. These methods allow scientists to isolate specific segments of DNA-for instance, a particular gene or part of a gene-which can then be further studied, manipulated, or used. It is also possible to create DNA synthetically through processes similarly well known in the field of genetics. One such method begins with an mRNA molecule and uses the natural bonding properties of nucleotides to create a new, synthetic DNA molecule. The result is the inverse of the mRNA's inverse image of the original DNA, with one important distinction: Because the natural creation of mRNA involves splicing that removes introns, the synthetic DNA created from mRNA also contains only the exon sequences. This synthetic DNA created in the laboratory from mRNA is known as complementary DNA (cDNA).

Changes in the genetic sequence are called mutations. Mutations can be as small as the alteration of a single nucleotide-a change affecting only one letter in the genetic code. Such small-scale changes can produce an entirely different amino acid or can end protein production altogether. Large changes, involving the deletion, rearrangement, or duplication of hundreds or even millions of nucleotides, can result in the elimination, misplacement, or duplication of entire genes. Some mutations are harmless, but others can cause disease or increase the risk of disease. As a result, the study of genetics can lead to valuable medical breakthroughs.

# B 

This case involves patents filed by Myriad after it made one such medical breakthrough. Myriad discovered the precise location and sequence of what are now known as the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Mutations in these genes can dramatically increase an individual's risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer. The average American woman has a 12 - to 13 -percent risk of developing breast cancer, but for women with certain genetic mutations, the risk can range between 50 and 80 percent for breast cancer and between 20 and 50 percent for ovarian cancer. Before Myriad's discovery of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, scientists knew that heredity played a role in establishing a woman's risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer, but they did not know which genes were associated with those cancers.

Myriad identified the exact location of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes on chromosomes 17 and 13. Chromosome 17 has approximately 80 million nucleotides, and chromosome 13 has approximately 114 million. Within those chromosomes, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are each about 80,000 nucleotides long. If just exons are counted, the BRCA1 gene is only about 5,500 nucleotides long; for the BRCA2 gene, that number is about 10,200 . Knowledge of the location of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes allowed Myriad to determine their typical nucleotide sequence. That information, in turn, enabled Myriad to develop medical tests that are useful for detecting mutations in a patient's BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes and thereby assessing whether the patient has an increased risk of cancer.

Once it found the location and sequence of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, Myriad sought and obtained a number of patents. Nine composition claims from three of those patents are at issue in this case. Claims 1, 2, 5, and 6 from [U.S. Patent 5,747,282] are representative. The first claim asserts a patent on "[a]n isolated DNA coding for a BRCA1 polypeptide," which has "the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:2." App. 822. SEQ ID NO:2 sets forth a list of 1,863 amino acids that the typical BRCA1 gene encodes. See id., at 785-790. Put differently, claim 1 asserts a patent claim on the DNA code that tells a cell to produce the string of BRCA1 amino acids listed in SEQ ID NO:2.

Claim 2 of the '282 patent operates similarly. It claims " [t] he isolated DNA of claim 1 , wherein said DNA has the nucleotide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:1." Like SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:1 sets forth a long list of data, in this instance the sequence of cDNA that codes for the BRCA1 amino acids listed in claim 1. Importantly, SEQ ID NO:1 lists only the cDNA exons in the BRCA1 gene, rather than a full DNA sequence containing both exons and introns. As a result, the Federal Circuit recognized that claim 2 asserts a patent on the cDNA nucleotide sequence listed in SEQ ID NO:1, which codes for the typical BRCA1 gene.

Claim 5 of the '282 patent claims a subset of the data in claim 1. In particular, it claims "[a]n isolated DNA having at least 15 nucleotides of the DNA of claim 1." App. 822. The practical effect of claim 5 is to assert a patent on any series of 15 nucleotides that exist in the typical BRCA1 gene. Because the BRCA1 gene is thousands of nucleotides long, even BRCA1 genes with substantial mutations are likely to contain at least one segment of 15 nucleotides that correspond to the typical BRCA1 gene. Similarly, claim 6 of the '282 patent claims "[a]n isolated DNA having at least 15 nucleotides of the DNA of claim 2." Ibid. This claim operates similarly to claim 5, except that it references the cDNA-based claim 2. The remaining claims at issue are similar, though several list common mutations rather than typical BRCA1 and BRCA2 sequences. See ibid. (claim 7 of the '282 patent); id., at 930 (claim 1 of the '473 patent); id., at 1028 (claims 1,6 , and 7 of the ' 492 patent).

# C 

Myriad's patents would, if valid, give it the exclusive right to isolate an individual's BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes (or any strand of 15 or more nucleotides within the genes) by breaking the covalent bonds that connect the DNA to the rest of the individual's genome. The patents would also give Myriad the exclusive right to synthetically create BRCA cDNA.

But isolation is necessary to conduct genetic testing, and Myriad was not the only entity to offer BRCA testing after it discovered the genes. The University of Pennsylvania's Genctic Diagnostic Laboratory (GDL) and others provided genetic testing services to women. Petitioner Dr. Harry Ostrer, then a researcher at New York University School of Medicine, routinely sent his patients' DNA samples to GDL for testing. After learning of GDL's testing and Ostrer's activities, Myriad sent letters to them asserting that the genetic testing infringed Myriad's patents. App. 94-95 (Ostrer letter). In response, GDL agreed to stop testing and informed Ostrer that it would no longer accept patient samples. Myriad also filed patent infringement suits against other entities that performed BRCA testing, resulting in settlements in which the defendants agreed to cease all allegedly infringing activity. Myriad, thus, solidified its position as the only entity providing BRCA testing.

Some years later, petitioner Ostrer, along with medical patients, advocacy groups, and other doctors, filed this lawsuit seeking a declaration that Myriad's patents are invalid under 35 U.S.C. §101. The District Court . . . granted summary judgment to petitioners on the composition claims at issue in this case based on its conclusion that Myriad's claims, including claims related to cDNA, were invalid because they covered products of nature. The Federal Circuit reversed, and this Court granted the petition for certiorari, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case in light of Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., 566 U.S. 66 (2012).

II A Section 101 of the Patent Act provides:
"Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful ... composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title."
35 U.S.C. §101.
We have "long held that this provision contains an important implicit exception[:] Laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas are not patentable." Mayo, 566 U.S., at 70. Rather, "'they are the basic tools of scientific and technological work"' that lie beyond the domain of patent protection. As the Court has explained, without this exception, there would be considerable danger that the grant of patents would "tie up" the use of such tools and thereby "inhibit future innovation premised upon them." This would be at odds with the very point of patents, which exist to promote creation.

The rule against patents on naturally occurring things is not without limits, however, for "all inventions at some level embody, use, reflect, rest upon, or apply laws of nature, natural phenomena, or abstract ideas," and "too broad an interpretation of this exclusionary principle could eviscerate patent law." 566 U.S., at 71. As we have recognized before, patent protection strikes a delicate balance between creating "incentives that lead to creation, invention, and discovery" and "imped[ing] the flow of information that might permit, indeed spur, invention." Id., at 92 . We must apply this well-established standard to determine whether Myriad's patents claim any "new and useful ... composition of matter," §101, or instead claim naturally occurring phenomena.
# B 

It is undisputed that Myriad did not create or alter any of the genetic information encoded in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. The location and order of the nucleotides existed in nature before Myriad found them. Nor did Myriad create or alter the genetic structure of DNA. Instead, Myriad's principal contribution was uncovering the precise location and genetic sequence of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes within chromosomes 17 and 13. The question is whether this renders the genes patentable.

Myriad recognizes that our decision in [Diamond v.] Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303 (1980)] is central to this inquiry. In Chakrabarty, scientists added four plasmids to a bacterium, which enabled it to break down various components of crude oil. 447 U.S., at 305 , and n.1. The Court held that the modified bacterium was patentable. The Chakrabarty bacterium was new "with markedly different characteristics from any found in nature," 447 U.S., at 310 , due to the additional plasmids and resultant "capacity for degrading oil." Id., at 305, n.1. In this case, by contrast, Myriad did not create anything. To be sure, it found an important and useful gene, but separating that gene from its surrounding genetic material is not an act of invention.

Groundbreaking, innovative, or even brilliant discovery does not by itself satisfy the §101 inquiry. In Funk Brothers Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co., 333 U.S. 127 (1948), this Court considered a composition patent that claimed a mixture of naturally occurring strains of bacteria that helped leguminous plants take nitrogen from the air and fix it in the soil. The Court held that the composition was not patent eligible because the patent holder did not alter the bacteria in any way. His patent claim thus fell squarely within the law of nature exception. So do Myriad's. Myriad found the location of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, but that discovery, by itself, does not render the BRCA genes "new ... composition[s] of matter," §101, that are patent eligible.

Indeed, Myriad's patent descriptions highlight the problem with its claims. For example, a section of the ' 282 patent's Detailed Description of the Invention indicates that Myriad found the location of a gene associated with increased risk of breast cancer and identified mutations of that gene that increase the risk. In subsequent language Myriad explains that the location of the gene was unknown until Myriad found it among the approximately eight million nucleotide pairs contained in a subpart of chromosome 17. Many of Myriad's patent descriptions simply detail the "iterative process" of discovery by which Myriad narrowed the possible locations for the gene sequences that it sought. Myriad seeks to import these extensive research efforts into the §101 patenteligibility inquiry. But extensive effort alone is insufficient to satisfy the demands of §101.

Nor are Myriad's claims saved by the fact that isolating DNA from the human genome severs chemical bonds and thereby creates a nonnaturally occurring molecule. Myriad's claims are simply not expressed in terms of chemical composition, nor do they rely in any way on the chemical changes that result from the isolation of a particular section of DNA. Instead, the claims understandably focus on the genetic information encoded in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. If the patents depended upon the creation of a unique molecule, then a would-be infringer could arguably avoid at least Myriad's patent claims on entire genes (such as claims 1 and 2 of the '282 patent) by isolating a DNA sequence that included both the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene and one additional nucleotide pair. Such a molecule would not be chemically identical to the molecule "invented" by Myriad. But Myriad obviously would resist that outcome because its claim is concerned primarily with the information contained in the genetic sequence, not with the specific chemical composition of a particular molecule.

Finally, Myriad argues that the PTO's past practice of awarding gene patents is entitled to deference, citing J.E.M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred Int'l, Inc., 534 U.S. 124 (2001). We disagree. Congress has not endorsed the views of the PTO in subsequent legislation.

Further undercutting the PTO's practice, the United States argued in the Federal Circuit and in this Court that isolated DNA was not patent eligible under §101, Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 20-33, and that the PTO's practice was not "a sufficient reason to hold that isolated DNA is patent-eligible." Id., at 26. See also id., at 28-29. These concessions weigh against deferring to the PTO's determination.

# C 

cDNA does not present the same obstacles to patentability as naturally occurring, isolated DNA segments. As already explained, creation of a cDNA sequence from mRNA results in an exons-only molecule that is not naturally occurring. Petitioners concede that cDNA differs from natural DNA in that "the non-coding regions have been removed." They nevertheless argue that cDNA is not patent eligible because " [t] he nucleotide sequence of cDNA is dictated by nature, not by the lab technician." That may be so, but the lab technician unquestionably creates something new when cDNA is made. cDNA retains the naturally occurring exons of DNA, but it is distinct from the DNA from which it was derived. As a result, cDNA is not a "product of nature" and is patent eligible under §101, except insofar as very short series of DNA may have no intervening introns to remove when creating cDNA. In that situation, a short strand of cDNA may be indistinguishable from natural DNA.

## III

It is important to note what is not implicated by this decision. First, there are no method claims before this Court. Had Myriad created an innovative method of manipulating genes while searching for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, it could possibly have sought a method patent. But the processes used by Myriad to isolate DNA were well understood by geneticists at the time of Myriad's patents [and so method claims were not available].

Similarly, this case does not involve patents on new applications of knowledge about the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Judge Bryson aptly noted that, "[a]s the first party with knowledge of the [BRCA1 and BRCA2] sequences. Myriad was in an excellent position to claim applications of that knowledge. Many of its unchallenged claims are limited to such applications." 689 F.3d, at 1349.

Nor do we consider the patentability of DNA in which the order of the naturally occurring nucleotides has been altered. Scientific alteration of the genetic code presents a different inquiry, and we express no opinion about the application of §101 to such endeavors. We merely hold that genes and the information they encode are not patent cligible under §101 simply because they have been isolated from the surrounding genetic material.

# COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS 

1. In invalidating Myriad's isolated DNA claims, the Court noted that the isolated DNA contained the same genetic information as naturally occurring genomic DNA and that Myriad did not create or alter this information. The Court also noted that "[a]s the first party with knowledge of the [BRCA1] sequences, Myriad was in an excellent position to claim applications of that knowledge." One very useful application is sequencing BRCA1 DNA for mutations to diagnose or prognose breast cancer. Should the patentee's identification of the function of the sequence and listing the sequence mean that the sequence is patentable? How about a method claim limited to the use of the sequence to diagnose susceptibility to breast cancer?
2. The Court affirmed the validity of Myriad's BRCA1 cDNA claims on the ground that BRCA1 cDNA was not naturally occurring and therefore not drawn to a judicial exception: "the lab technician unquestionably creates something new when cDNA is made." cDNA, however, contains the same genetic information as naturally occurring mRNA and Myriad did not create or alter this information. The act of reversetranscribing natural mRNA into cDNA was known, routine, and conventional when the Myriad patents were filed in 1994. See Jeffrey A. Lefstin, The Three Faces of Prometheus: A Post-Alice Jurisprudence of Abstractions, 16 N.C. J.L. \& TECH. 647, 678-79 (2015). Are the chemical differences between cDNA and mRNA sufficient to make cDNA patentable? Would your answer change if you were presented evidence that isolated DNA is similarly chemically different from genomic DNA? (This was in fact an emphasis in some of the Federal Circuit opinions in Myriad.) How can the conventional (non-inventive) application of an unpatentable product of nature (genomic DNA) result in a patentable composition (cDNA)? Note that the Court does not mention Mayo and the "inventive concept" test in distinguishing cDNA from gDNA.

Lower courts have not read Myriad's discussion of cDNA expansively. They have refused to patent human gene sequences modified with other standard but non-naturallyoccurring material like primers. In re BRCA1- and BRCA2-Based Heredity Cancer Test Patent Litig., 774 F.3d 755 (Fed. Cir. 2014).
3. Justice Scalia concurred in part and concurred in the judgment. Here is the entirety of his opinion:

I join the judgment of the Court, and all of its opinion except Part I-A and some portions of the rest of the opinion going into fine details of molecular biology. I am unable to affirm those details on my own knowledge or even my own belief. It suffices for me to affirm, having studied the opinions below and the expert bricfs presented here, that the portion of DNA isolated from its natural state sought to be patented is identical to that portion of the DNA in its natural state; and that complementary DNA (cDNA) is a synthetic creation not normally present in nature.
Is Justice Scalia concerned that his colleagues on the Court lack the capacity to resolve patent cases involving advanced scientific issues? As just noted, arguably he was right to be so concerned. The majority did not appear to understand the simplicity of the relationship between gDNA and cDNA or how easy it is to make cDNA. It is notable that Judge Learned Hand, widely considered one of the most accomplished intellectual property jurists, voiced a similar sentiment in the concluding paragraph of the ParkeDavis opinion.

I cannot stop without calling attention to the extraordinary condition of the law which makes it possible for a man without any knowledge of even the rudiments of chemistry to pass upon such questions as these. The inordinate expense of time is the least of the resulting evils, for only a trained chemist is really capable of passing upon such facts . . . In Germany, where the national spirit eagerly seeks for all the assistance it can get from the whole range of human knowledge, they do quite differently. The court summons technical judges to whom technical questions are submitted and who can intelligently pass upon the issues without blindly groping among testimony upon matters wholly out of their ken. How long we shall continue to blunder along without the aid of unpartisan and authoritative scientific assistance in the administration of justice, no one knows; but all fair persons not conventionalized by provincial legal habits of mind ought, I should think, unite to effect some such advance.
Parke-Davis \& Co. v. H.K. Mulford Co., 189 F. 95, 115 (C.C.S.D.N.Y 1911). Germany uses a three-judge panel, including a technical expert, on its patent cases. What are the benefits and drawbacks of employing technically trained judges instead of generalists to adjudicate patent cases?
4. Courts and the PTO considered DNA compositions to be patent-eligible (subject to meeting the separate utility requirement, which we will turn to in Chapter III(B)(5)) beginning in the 1980s. By the time Myriad was decided, the era of new human gene patents was effectively over; the human genome had been sequenced more than a decade before. In what ways do you think the history of the BRCA1 discovery might have been different if isolated DNA was not considered patent-eligible subject matter in the 1990s? What about the development of genetic tests for breast cancer?

# PROBLEM III-10 

Expectant parents have long sought to know about the health of their fetus. Through amniocentesis, doctors have been able to extract fluid from the amniotic sac surrounding the developing fetus to conduct various tests to determine genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome. Amniocentesis is usually done when a woman is between fourteen and sixteen weeks pregnant. The procedure is typically limited to women who have an elevated risk for genetic or chromosomal problems. The test is invasive and poses small but significant risks to the fetus and mother, such as miscarriage, needle injury to the fetus, and transmission of infection such as HIV or hepatitis C from an infected mother to fetus.

In 1996, Drs. Dennis Lo and James Wainscoat discovered cell-free fetal DNA ("cffDNA") in maternal plasma and serum. cffDNA is non-cellular fetal DNA that circulates freely in a pregnant woman's blood. Drs. Lo and Wainscoat implemented a method for detecting the small fraction of paternally inherited cffDNA in maternal plasma or serum to determine fetal characteristics, such as gender and genetic abnormalities. The invention, commercialized by Sequenom as its MaterniT21 test, created a non-invasive alternative technique to analyze fetal DNA that avoids the risks of amniocentesis.

In 1999, they filed a patent application that claimed these non-invasive prenatal diagnosis methods:

1. A method for detecting a paternally inherited nucleic acid of fetal origin performed on a maternal serum or plasma sample from a pregnant female, which method comprises amplifying a paternally inherited nucleic acid from the serum or plasma sample and detecting the presence of a paternally inherited nucleic acid of fetal origin in the sample.

The specification provides, in pertinent part:

# SUMMARY AND OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION 

It has now been discovered that foetal DNA is detectable in maternal serum or plasma samples. This is a surprising and unexpected finding; maternal plasma is the very material that is routinely discarded by investigators studying noninvasive prenatal diagnosis using foetal cells in maternal blood.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS

The preparation of serum or plasma from the maternal blood sample is carried out by standard techniques. . . . Standard nucleic acid amplification systems can be used, including PCR [polymerase chain reaction], the ligase chain reaction, nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASBA), branched DNA methods, and so on.
[O]ne skilled in the art is aware of a variety of techniques which might be used to detect different nucleic acid species. . . . These techniques are a matter of routine for one skilled in the art for the analysis of DNA.

The PTO granted Drs. Lo and Wainscoat U.S. Patent No. 6,258,540 in 2001. When Sequenom learned that Ariosa Diagnostics was offering non-invasive fetal diagnostic testing, it threatened to sue. Ariosa filed a declaratory relief action seeking to invalidate the ' 540 patent under §101. How should this case be decided under the applicable Supreme Court decisions?
# iv. Reassessing Patent Eligibility 

The role of Section 101 of the Patent Act has undergone convulsive change through judicial interpretation over the past two decades. From the Federal Circuit's dismantling of eligibility limitations in State Street Bank to the Supreme Court's revival and expansion of eligibility limitations in Mayo and Alice to the Federal Circuit's latest pronouncements in Berkheimer and Vanda, inventors, venture capitalists, and patent attorneys have weathered an unremitting storm. It remains to be seen how this battleground will ultimately play out.

## Berkheimer v. HP Inc. <br> United States Court of Appeals, Federal Circuit 890 F.3d 1369 (2018)

LOURIE, CIRCUIT JUDGE, with whom NEWMAN, CIRCUIT JUDGE, joins, concurring in the denial of the petition for rehearing en banc.
... I believe the law needs clarification by higher authority, perhaps by Congress, to work its way out of what so many in the innovation field consider are §101 problems. Individual cases, whether heard by this court or the Supreme Court, are imperfect vehicles for enunciating broad principles because they are limited to the facts presented. Section 101 issues certainly require attention beyond the power of this court.

We started from the statute that provides for patents on "any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter." 35 U.S.C. §101. The Supreme Court put a gloss on this provision by excluding laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. Le Roy v. Tatham, 55 U.S. (14 How.) 156, 174-75 (1852) ("[A] principle is not patentable. A principle, in the abstract, is a fundamental truth; an original cause; a motive; these cannot be patented, as no one can claim in either of them an exclusive right."); Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303, 309 (1980) ("The laws of nature, physical phenomena, and abstract ideas have been held not patentable."). So far, so good. Laws of nature (Ohm's Law, Boyle's Law, the equivalence of matter and energy), properly construed, should not be eligible for patent. Nor should natural phenomena (lightning, earthquakes, rain, gravity, sunlight) or natural products, per se (blood, brain, skin). Of course, the latter are also unpatentable as lacking novelty under §102.

But it's in the details that problems and uncertainties have arisen. The Court held in Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., that the claim at issue "set forth laws of nature" and was ineligible under §101 as "a drafting effort designed to monopolize the law of nature itself." 566 U.S. 66, 77 (2012). That claim recited "[a] method of optimizing therapeutic efficacy for treatment of an immune-mediated gastrointestinal disorder, comprising" administering a drug and then measuring the level of a metabolite of the drug. Id. at 74-75.

The Supreme Court whittled away at the §101 statute in Mayo by analyzing abstract ideas and natural phenomena with a two-step test, including looking for an "inventive concept" at step two, thereby bringing aspects of §§102 and 103 into the eligibility analysis. Id. at 72-73,90. The decision we now decide not to rehear en banc holds that step two of the two-step analysis may involve the type of fact-finding that underlies §§102 and 103, further complicating what used to be a fairly simple analysis of patent eligibility under §101. We now are interpreting what began, when it rarely arose, as a simple §101 analysis, as a complicated multiple-step consideration of inventiveness ("something more"), with the result that an increasing amount of inventive research is no longer subject to patent. For example, because the Mayo analysis forecloses identifying any "inventive concept" in the discovery of natural phenomena, we have held as ineligible subject matter even meritorious inventions that "combined and utilized man-made tools of biotechnology in a way that revolutionized prenatal care." Ariosa Diagnostics, Inc. v. Sequenom, Inc., 788 F.3d 1371, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted).

The case before us involves the abstract idea exception to the statute. Abstract ideas indeed should not be subject to patent. They are products of the mind, mental steps, not capable of being controlled by others, regardless what a statute or patent claim might say. Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U.S. 63, 67 (1972) ("[M]ental processes, and abstract intellectual concepts are not patentable, as they are the basic tools of scientific and technological work."). No one should be inhibited from thinking by a patent. See Letter from Thomas Jefferson to Isaac McPherson (Aug. 13, 1813) ("[I]f nature has made any one thing less susceptible, than all others, of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an Idea."). Thus, many brilliant and unconventional ideas must be beyond patenting simply because they are "only" ideas, which cannot be monopolized. Moreover such a patent would be unenforceable. Who knows what people are thinking?

But why should there be a step two in an abstract idea analysis at all? If a method is entirely abstract, is it no less abstract because it contains an inventive step? And, if a claim recites "something more," an "inventive" physical or technological step, it is not an abstract idea, and can be examined under established patentability provisions such as §§102 and 103. Step two's prohibition on identifying the something more from "computer functions [that] are 'well-understood, routine, conventional activit[ies]' previously known to the industry," Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int'l, 573 U.S. 208, 225 (2014) (alteration in original) (quoting Mayo, 566 U.S. at 73), is essentially a §§102 and 103 inquiry. Section 101 does not need a two-step analysis to determine whether an idea is abstract.

I therefore believe that §101 requires further authoritative treatment. Thinking further concerning §101, but beyond these cases, steps that utilize natural processes, as all mechanical, chemical, and biological steps do, should be patent-eligible, provided they meet the other tests of the statute, including novelty, nonobviousness, and written description. A claim to a natural process itself should not be patentable, not least because it lacks novelty, but also because natural processes should be available to all. But claims to using such processes should not be barred at the threshold of a patentability analysis by being considered natural laws, as a method that utilizes a natural law is not itself a natural law.
The Supreme Court also held in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., that claims to isolated natural products were ineligible for claiming "naturally occurring phenomena." 569 U.S. 576, 590 (2013). The Court concluded that those claims "are not patent eligible simply because they have been isolated from the surrounding genetic material." Id. at 596.

However, finding, isolating, and purifying such products are genuine acts of inventiveness, which should be incentivized and rewarded by patents. We are all aware of the need for new antibiotics because bacteria have become resistant to our existing products. Nature, including soil and plants, is a fertile possible source of new antibiotics, but there will be much scientific work to be done to find or discover, isolate, and purify any such products before they can be useful to us. Industry should not be deprived of the incentive to develop such products that a patent creates. But, while they are part of the same patent-eligibility problems we face, these specific issues are not in the cases before us.

Accordingly, I concur in the decision of the court not to rehear this §101 case en banc. Even if it was decided wrongly, which I doubt, it would not work us out of the current §101 dilemma. In fact, it digs the hole deeper by further complicating the §101 analysis. Resolution of patent-eligibility issues requires higher intervention, hopefully with ideas reflective of the best thinking that can be brought to bear on the subject.

# COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS 

1. Do you agree with Judge Lourie's assessment of §101 ? Does the Supreme Court's Mayo/Alice framework conflate §101 with §§102 and 103? Does the Court's preemption rationale improperly bring §112 patent scope considerations into §101 analysis? Has the Supreme Court read "discovery" out of the Patent Act?
2. Should Congress intervene? If so, how? See generally: Jeffrey A. Lefstin, Peter S. Menell, \& David O. Taylor, Final Report of the Berkeley Center for Law \& Technology Section 101 Workshop: Addressing Patent Eligibility Challenges, 33 BERKELEY TECH. L.J. 551 (2018). §

## PROBLEM III-11

The "Patent Eligibility Restoration Act," introduced by Senators Tillis and Coons, "finds" that efforts of district court, Federal Circuit, and PTO examiners to apply the judicial exceptions to patent eligibility (laws of nature, physical phenomena, and abstract ideas) have led to "extensive confusion and a lack of consistency." As a corrective, the bill's authors propose to eliminate the judicial exceptions while expressing excluding particular categories from patent eligibility. The revised provision would provide:
§101. Patent eligibility (a) In General.-Whoever invents or discovers any useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject only to the exclusions in subsection (b) and to the further conditions and requirements of this title.
(b) Eligibility Exclusions.- (1) In General.-Subject to paragraph (2), a person may not obtain a patent for any of the following, if claimed as such:
(A) A mathematical formula that is not part of a claimed invention in a category described in subsection (a).
(B)(i) Subject to clause (ii), a process that is substantially cconomic, financial, business, social, cultural, or artistic, even though not less than 1 step in the process refers to a machine or manufacture.
(ii) The process described in clause (i) shall not be excluded from eligibility for a patent if the process cannot practically be performed without the use of a machine or manufacture.
(C) A process that- (i) is a mental process performed solely in the human mind; or (ii) occurs in nature wholly independent of, and prior to, any human activity.
(D) An unmodified human gene, as that gene exists in the human body.
(E) An unmodified natural material, as that material exists in nature.
(2) Conditions.-For the purposes of subparagraphs (D) and (E) of paragraph (1), a human gene or natural material shall not be considered to be unmodified if the gene or material, as applicable, is- (A) isolated, purified, enriched, or otherwise altered by human activity; or (B) otherwise employed in a useful invention or discovery.

What, if anything, would be unpatentable subject matter under this bill? Would patent law extend to a new song played on a guitar? to a process for dividing one number by another that involves writing the numbers on paper? to a naturally-occurring metal that must be excavated from surrounding rock?

Would this reform improve the patent system? How might this legislation be improved?


^7 The AIA, for the first time, expressly excludes specific subject matter categories, namely patents on tax strategies and human organisms. See Pub. L. 112 29, §§14, 33, 125 Stat. 284 (2011).
^8 Justices Burton and Jackson dissented, finding the product claims within the scope of patentable subject matter and adequately disclosed. Funk Bros., at 136.
^9 Justice Brennan, joined by Justices White, Marshall, and Powell, dissented on the grounds that the 1930 and 1970 plant patent statutes indicate that that Congress did not believe that newly developed living organisms were patentable under §101. Id. at 320-21.
^10 The full passage from which this quotation was taken is arguably less expansive.

See Brief Amici Curiae of Professors Peter S. Menell and Michael J. Meurer In Support of Respondent, Bilski v. Kappos, U.S. S.Ct.

^11 Genetic linkage analysis is based on the tendency for genes and other genetic markers to be inherited together because of their location near one another on the same chromosome. A gene is a functional physical unit of heredity that can be passed from parent to child. Because DNA segments that lie near each other on a chromosome tend to be inherited together, markers are often used as tools for tracking the inheritance pattern of a gene that has not yet been identified but whose approximate location is known. Linkage analysis uses statistical measures to estimate linkage of DNA and genetic traits.
