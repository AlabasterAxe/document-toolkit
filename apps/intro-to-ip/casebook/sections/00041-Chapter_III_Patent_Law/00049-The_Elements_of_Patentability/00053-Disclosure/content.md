A patent can be a potent right. In exchange for this government grant, an inventor must disclose the workings of the invention in enough detail to be informative to other people working in the same field. The sufficiency of the patentee's disclosure, and its relationship to the claims of a patent, are the topics we consider in this section.

The overall goal when drafting patent claims is to make them as broad as the Patent Office will allow. There are two constraints on the breadth of the claims you can draft: (a) the mass of publicly available information on your problem-"the prior art" that is essential to novelty and nonobviousness analysis; and (b) the actual work the inventor has done, in the sense that the inventor may not claim beyond what they have invented and described.

The disclosure requirement of the modern Patent Act provides:
§112(a) The specification shall contain a written description of the invention, and of the manner and process of making and using it, in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make and use the same, and shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention.
This provision comprises three requirements: (i) enablement; (ii) written description; and (iii) best mode. We take each of these sections up in turn. Sections 112(b)-(f) deal with how patents are claimed, as opposed to the adequacy of disclosure. ^4 We will cover these issues in the section on claim construction.

# i. Enablement 

## Amgen Inc. v. Sanofi Supreme Court of the United States 598 U.S. 594 (2023)

JUSTICE GORSUCH delivered the opinion of the Court.
The development of antibody drugs has yielded life-changing therapies. Individuals across the world now rely on antibody drugs to treat conditions ranging from Crohn's disease to cancer. This case concerns patents covering antibodies that help reduce levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, sometimes called LDL cholesterol (for the obvious reason) or bad cholesterol (because it can lead to cardiovascular disease, heart attacks, and strokes).

The case comes to us this way. Several years ago, petitioners (Amgen) obtained two patents. Together, these patents claim a monopoly over all antibodies that (1) bind to specific amino acids on a naturally occurring protein known as PCSK9, and (2) block PCSK9 from impairing the body's mechanism for removing LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream. Soon after receiving these patents, Amgen sued respondents (Sanofi) for infringement. In response, Sanofi argued that the patents were invalid under §112 of the Patent Act. That provision requires a patent applicant to describe its invention "in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art ... to make and use the [invention]." 35 U.S.C. §112(a). Sanofi contended that Amgen's patents failed to meet this standard because they sought to claim for Amgen's exclusive use potentially millions more antibodies than the company had taught scientists to make. In the end, both the district court and Federal Circuit sided with Sanofi. The question we face is whether to disturb their judgment.

# B. THE ELEMENTS OF PATENTABILITY 

The immune system produces antibodies as a defense to foreign agents called antigens. When a particular antigen-a virus, for example-enters the body, the immune system generates antibodies to attack it. In a successful attack, the antibodies target and bind to the antigen, stopping it from causing harm to the body. See Brief for Sir Gregory Paul Winter et al. as Amici Curiae 8 (Winter Brief); M. Lemley \& J. Sherkow, The Antibody Patent Paradox, 132 Yale L. J. 994, 1001-02 (2023).

Antibodies are incredibly diverse. Some scientists estimate that there may be as many unique antibodies as there are stars in the galaxy. See id., at 1003; see also B. Briney, A. Inderbitzin, C. Joyce, \& D. Burton, Commonality Despite Exceptional Diversity in the Baseline Human Antibody Repertoire, 566 NATURE 393, 397 (No. 7744, Feb. 2019) (estimating that the immune system could potentially generate up to a quintillion unique antibodies). This diversity shows up in both structure and function.

Start with structure. "When scientists refer to an antibody's 'structure," they may have in mind "several related concepts," each of which describes "what an antibody is." Winter Brief 10. Antibodies are made up of amino acids, and scientists commonly identify a particular antibody according to its specific sequence of amino acids-what they call an antibody's "'primary structure.'" But antibodies are not just linear chains of amino acids. As the atoms of the amino acids interact with each other, they create folds that result in complex three-dimensional shapes. Ibid. Scientists refer to an antibody's intricate topography as its "tertiary structure."

An antibody's structure does much to dictate its function-its ability to bind to an antigen and, in some instances, to block other molecules in the body from doing the same. "For an antibody to bind to an antigen, the two surfaces have to fit together and contact each other at multiple points." But just because an antibody can bind to an antigen does not mean that it can also block. To bind and block, the antibody must establish a sufficiently broad, strong, and stable bond to the antigen. See ibid. Different antibodies have different binding and blocking capacities based on the amino acids that compose them and their three-dimensional shapes.

Despite recent advances, aspects of antibody science remain unpredictable. For example, scientists understand that changing even one amino acid in the sequence can alter an antibody's structure and function. But scientists cannot always accurately predict exactly how trading one amino acid for another will affect an antibody's structure and function. 'As Amgen's expert testified at trial: " [T] he way in which you get from sequence to that three-dimensional structure isn't fully understood today. It's going to get a Nobel Prize for somebody at some point, but translating that sequence into a known three-dimensional structure is still not possible.'"

## B

While the immune system naturally produces an army of antibodies to protect us from various harms, scientists are now able to engineer antibodies to assist in treating diseases. Some of these lab-made antibodies target not foreign agents but the body's own proteins, receptors, and ligands. "While naturally occurring in our bodies, these [proteins, receptors, and ligands] can also be involved in inflammatory disorders, uncontrolled cell growth, or other biological pathways that may be associated with disease."

One part of this effort has focused on the creation of antibodies to treat patients with high LDL cholesterol. A silent killer, LDL cholesterol can contribute to the formation of plaque in the arteries that may lead to cardiovascular disease, heart attacks, and strokes. For many people with high LDL cholesterol, drugs called statins offer an effective treatment. For others, statins do not work well or come with unwelcome side effects. In those cases, a relatively new antibody-based treatment known as a PCSK9 inhibitor may be appropriate. See Amgen Inc. v. Sanofi, 872 F.3d 1367, 1371 (C.A. Fed. 2017).

Eventually, Amgen developed a PCSK9-inhibiting drug that it marketed under the name Repatha, and Sanofi produced one it labeled Praluent. Each drug employs a distinct antibody with its own unique amino acid sequence. In 2011, Amgen obtained a patent for the antibody employed in Repatha, and Sanofi received one covering the antibody used in Praluent. Each patent describes the relevant antibody by its amino acid sequence. Neither of these patents is at issue in this case.

Instead, our dispute focuses on two additional patents Amgen obtained in 2014 that relate back to the company's 2011 patent. See U. S. Patent No. 8,829,165 (Sept. 9, 2014); U. S. Patent No. 8,859,741 (Oct. 14, 2014). We refer to them as the ' 165 and ' 741 patents. In particular, this case revolves around claims 19 and 29 of the ' 165 patent and claim 7 of the ' 741 patent. See 987 F.3d 1080, 1082 (C.A. Fed. 2021). In these claims, Amgen did not seek protection for any particular antibody described by amino acid sequence. Instead, Amgen purported to claim for itself "the entire genus" of antibodies that (1) "bind to specific amino acid residues on PCSK9," and (2) "block PCSK9 from binding to [LDL receptors]." Amgen, 872 F.3d, at 1372.

As part of its submission to the patent office, Amgen identified the amino acid sequences of 26 antibodies that perform these two functions, and it depicted the threedimensional structures of two of these 26 antibodies. But beyond that, Amgen only offered scientists two methods to make other antibodies that perform the binding and blocking functions it described. The first method is what Amgen calls the "roadmap." At a high level, the roadmap directs scientists to: (1) generate a range of antibodies in the lab; (2) test those antibodies to determine whether any bind to PCSK9; (3) test those antibodies that bind to PCSK9 to determine whether any bind to the sweet spot as described in the claims; and (4) test those antibodies that bind to the sweet spot as described in the claims to determine whether any block PCSK9 from binding to LDL receptors. The second method is what Amgen calls "conservative substitution." This technique requires scientists to: (1) start with an antibody known to perform the described functions; (2) replace select amino acids in the antibody with other amino acids known to have similar properties; and (3) test the resulting antibody to see if it also performs the described functions.
# C 

... While Amgen had identified the amino acid sequences of 26 antibodies that bind to PCSK9 and block it from binding to LDL receptors, Sanofi observed that Amgen's claims cover potentially millions more undisclosed antibodies that perform these same functions. And, Sanofi argued, neither of the two methods Amgen had outlined for generating additional antibodies with the same functions enable a person skilled in the art to do so reliably. Instead, Sanofi submitted, those methods require scientists to engage in little more than a trial-and-error process of discovery. See id., at 1085.
[Two jurics held that the claims were enabled]. The district court granted Sanofi judgment as a matter of law, concluding that the claims at issue "are not enabled." 2019 WL 4058927, *13 (D. Del., Aug. 28, 2019). The Federal Circuit affirmed. 987 F.3d, at 1088. . . .

## II

The Constitution vests Congress with the power to "promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries." Art. I, §8, cl. 8. Right there in the text, one finds the outline of what this Court has called the patent "bargain." Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U.S. 141, 150 (1989). In exchange for bringing "new designs and technologies into the public domain through disclosure," so they may benefit all, an inventor receives a limited term of "protection from competitive exploitation." Id., at 151; see also The Federalist No. 43, p. 272 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison) (explaining that in such cases "[t]he public good fully coincides ... with the claims of individuals").

Congress has exercised this authority from the start. The Patent Act of 1790 promised up to a 14 -year monopoly to any applicant who "invented or discovered any useful art, manufacture, . . . or device, or any improvement therein not before known or used." Act of Apr. 10, 1790, §1, 1 Stat. 110. Reflecting the quid-pro-quo premise of patent law, the statute required the applicant to deposit with the Secretary of State a "specification ... so particular . . . as not only to distinguish the invention or discovery from other things before known and used, but also to enable a workman or other person skilled in the art or manufacture . . . to make, construct, or use the same." §2. The statute made clear that this disclosure would ensure "the public may have the full benefit [of the invention or discovery], after the expiration of the patent term.".

Even as Congress has revised the patent laws over time, it has left this "enablement" obligation largely intact. See 35 U.S.C. §§111,112. Section 111 of the current Patent Act provides that a patent application "shall include . . . a specification as prescribed by section 112." §111(a)(2)(A). Section 112, in turn, requires a specification to include "a written description of the invention, and of the manner and process of making and using it, in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art ... to make and use the same." §112 (a). So today, just as in 1790 , the law secures for the public its benefit of the patent bargain by ensuring that, "upon the expiration of [the patent], the knowledge of the invention [i]nures to the people, who are thus enabled without restriction to practice it." United States v. Dubilier Condenser Corp., 289 U.S. 178, 187 (1933); see also Grant v. Raymond, 6 Pet. 218, 247 (1832) (Marshall, C. J.) ("This is necessary in order to give the public, after the privilege shall expire, the advantage for which the privilege is allowed, and is the foundation of the power to issue a patent."); Whittemore v. Cutter, 29 F.Cas. 1120, 1122 (No. 17,600) (CC Mass. 1813) (STORY, J.) ("If therefore [the disclosure] be so obscure, loose, and imperfect, that this cannot be done, it is defrauding the public of all the consideration, upon which the monopoly is granted.").

This Court has addressed the enablement requirement on many prior occasions. See, e.g., Wood v. Underhill, 5 How. 1 (1846); O'Reilly v. Morse, 15 How. 62 (1854); The Incandescent Lamp Patent, 159 U.S. 465 (1895); Minerals Separation, Ltd. v. Hyde, 242 U.S. 261 (1916); Holland Furniture Co. v. Perkins Glue Co., 277 U.S. 245 (1928). While the technologies in these older cases may seem a world away from the antibody treatments of today, the decisions are no less instructive for it.

Begin with Morse. While crossing the Atlantic Occan in 1832 aboard a ship named Sully, Samuel Morse found himself in conversation with other passengers about "experiments and discoveries" around electromagnetism. 15 How. at 68. "In the course of this discussion, it occurred to [Morse] that, by means of electricity, signs representing figures, letters, or words, might be legibly written down at any distance." So clear was the idea in Morse's mind that, "[b]efore he landed in the United States, he had ... drawn out in his sketch book . . . the form of an instrument for an electro-magnetic telegraph." Immediately upon his arrival in New York, Morse showed his brothers his sketches. He spent the next few years refining his invention. The "great difficulty" he faced was that "the galvanic current, however strong in the beginning, became gradually weaker as it advanced on the wire[,] and was not strong enough to produce a mechanical effect, after a certain distance." By 1837, Morse had a solution: "combining two or more electric or galvanic circuits, with independent batteries for the purpose of overcoming the diminished force of electro-magnetism in long circuits." Morse demonstrated his telegraph the following year at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, and he displayed it soon after in Congress. He received a patent in 1840, which reissued in 1848.

The litigation that brought Morse before this Court concerned a telegraphic system that Henry O'Reilly had installed between Louisville and Nashville. Morse sued O'Reilly for infringement, alleging that O'Reilly's system was "identical with" Morse's own. O'Reilly mounted a number of defenses, including that Morse's patent was void because it lacked an adequate specification.

Morse's patent included eight claims, and this Court had no trouble upholding seven of them-those limited to the telegraphic structures and systems he had designed. But the Court paused on the eighth. That claim covered "the essence" of the invention, which Morse described as "the use of the motive power of the electric or galvanic current . . . however developed for marking or printing intelligible characters, signs, or letters, at any distances." Leaving no doubt about this claim's scope, Morse stated plainly: "I do not propose to limit myself to the specific machinery or parts of machinery described in the foregoing specification and claims."
The Court held the eighth claim "too broad, and not warranted by law." The problem was that it covered all means of achieving telegraphic communication, yet Morse had not described how to make and use them all. See id., at 113-17. "[I]f the eighth claim . . . can be maintained," the Court concluded, "there was no necessity for any specification, further than to say that he had discovered that, by using the motive power of electromagnetism, he could print intelligible characters at any distance." 15 How. at 119. "[I]t will be admitted on all hands, that no patent could have issued on such a specification."

Consider, too, Incandescent Lamp. For much of the 19th century, gas lamps helped illuminate streets and supplemented candles inside homes, factories, offices, and theaters. But gas lighting had drawbacks. It took effort to ignite lamps each night and extinguish them each morning. Then there were the problems of soot and fumes. See R. Stross, The Wizard of Menlo Park 84-85 (2007) (Stross). By the 1870s, many had experimented with other forms of lighting, including incandescence and the are light. 159 U.S., at 470 . But these alternatives burned unreliably or with unbearable brightness. See id., at 470-71. The latter problem in particular led one observer to lament this "new sort of urban star," which shines "horrible, unearthly, obnoxious" light. R. L. Stevenson, A Plea for Gas Lamps, in Virginibus Puerisque and Other Papers 295 (1881).

Enter Thomas Edison. From his laboratory in Menlo Park, Edison and a team toiled to improve upon the prevailing method of incandescent lighting, which tended to employ carbon filaments. 159 U.S., at 471-73. The problem with carbon filaments was that they disintegrated rapidly. In a sense, "carbon contained in itself the elements of its own destruction." Seeking an alternative, Edison tinkered for a time with platinum, but it was expensive and difficult to bring to the point of incandescence without melting. Eventually, Edison dispatched men across the globe to collect specimens of bamboo. One sample from Japan worked brilliantly because "[its] fibres [ran] more nearly parallel than in other species of wood." Satisfied, Edison arranged to have a Japanese farmer supply all of the bamboo he would ever need.

But there was a catch. William Sawyer and Albon Man had obtained a patent for an "electric lamp" with an "incandescing conductor" made of "carbonized fibrous or textile material," which they claimed was an improvement over conductors made of "mineral or gas carbon." Sawyer and Man's patent had not won them commercial success. They had designed a lamp with a conductor made of carbonized paper, but the lamp proved defective and quickly fell out of use. Still, their failure did not stop them from seeking to share in some of Edison's success. Sawyer and Man alleged that Edison's lamp infringed their patent because it "made use of a fibrous or textile material, covered by the patent." What was that offending material? Bamboo.

This Court sided with Edison. It held that Sawyer and Man's patent claimed much but enabled little. "Sawyer and Man supposed they had discovered in carbonized paper the best material for an incandescent conductor." But "[i]nstead of confining themselves to carbonized paper, as they might properly have done, and in fact did in their third claim, they made a broad claim for every fibrous and textile material." Even that broad claim "might" have been permissible, the Court allowed, if Sawyer and Man had disclosed "a quality common" to fibrous and textile substances that made them "peculiarly" adapted to incandescent lighting. Had they done so, others would have known how to select among such materials to make an operable lamp. But the record showed that most fibrous and textile materials failed to work. Only through "painstaking experimentation" did Edison discover that bamboo "answered the required purpose." The Court summed up things this way: "[T]he fact that paper happens to belong to the fibrous kingdom did not invest [Sawyer and Man] with sovereignty over this entire kingdom."

The Court returned to these principles in Holland Furniture. There, the evidence indicated that animal glue has properties that have long made it excellent for wood veneering. See 277 U.S., at 247. Seeking a substitute, Perkins Glue Company had developed and patented a starch glue similar enough to animal glue that craftsmen could also use it for wood veneering. Yet Perkins's patent included a claim that went beyond the specific starch glue it manufactured. This claim covered all "starch glue which, [when] combined with about three parts or less by weight of water, will have substantially the same properties as animal glue." Perkins's specification instructed gluemakers to choose a "starch ingredient" with "such qualities" that it would yield a product "'as good as animal glue'" for wood veneering "when combined with three parts of water and with alkali."

The Court held this broad claim invalid for lack of enablement. The specification described the key input-the "starch ingredient"-in terms of its "use or function" rather than its "physical characteristics or chemical properties." And that left gluemakers in a bind. As the Court put it: "One attempting to use or avoid the use of Perkins' discovery as so claimed and described functionally could do so only after elaborate experimentation" with different starches. To be sure, the Court held, Perkins was entitled to its patent on the specific starch glue it had invented. The specification described that glue's "characteristic ingredient" with "particularity." But just as Morse could not claim all means of telegraphic communication, and Sawyer and Man could not claim all fibrous and textile materials for incandescence, Perkins could not claim all starch glues made from whatever starch happened to perform as well as animal glue. To hold otherwise, the Court said, "would extend the monopoly beyond the invention."

Our decisions in Morse, Incandescent Lamp, and Holland Furniture reinforce the simple statutory command. If a patent claims an entire class of processes, machines, manufactures, or compositions of matter, the patent's specification must enable a person skilled in the art to make and use the entire class. In other words, the specification must enable the full scope of the invention as defined by its claims. The more one claims, the more one must enable. See §112(a); see also Continental Paper Bag Co. v. Eastern Paper Bag Co., 210 U.S. 405,419 (1908) ("[T]he claims measure the invention.").

That is not to say a specification always must describe with particularity how to make and use every single embodiment within a claimed class. For instance, it may suffice to give an example (or a few examples) if the specification also discloses "some general quality . . . running through" the class that gives it "a peculiar fitness for the particular purpose." Incandescent Lamp, 159 U.S., at 475. In some cases, disclosing that general quality may reliably enable a person skilled in the art to make and use all of what is claimed, not merely a subset. See id., at 475-76. ^5

Nor is a specification necessarily inadequate just because it leaves the skilled artist to engage in some measure of adaptation or testing. In Wood, a patent claimed a process for making bricks by mixing coal dust into clay. 5 How., at 4. The patent included "a general rule" about the proportion of dust and clay to use and offered two alternative proportions "where the clay has some peculiarity." The Court upheld the claim, recognizing that "some small difference in the proportions must occasionally be required" given the varieties of clay. Similarly, in Minerals Separation, the Court dismissed a challenge to a claimed process for separating metal from mineral ores. 242 U.S., at 270 . The record showed that "preliminary tests" were required to adapt the process to any particular ore. Once more, the Court explained that "the certainty which the law requires in patents is not greater than is reasonable." And because the "composition of ores varies infinitely," it was "impossible to specify in a patent the precise treatment which would be most successful and economical in each case." Id., at 271.^6

Decisions such as Wood and Minerals Separation establish that a specification may call for a reasonable amount of experimentation to make and use a patented invention. What is reasonable in any case will depend on the nature of the invention and the underlying art. See Minerals Separation, 242 U.S., at 270-71; see also Mowry v. Whitney, 14 Wall. 620, 644 (1872) ("[T]he definiteness of a specification must vary with the nature of its subject. Addressed as it is to those skilled in the art, it may leave something to their skill in applying the invention."). But in allowing that much tolerance, courts cannot detract from the basic statutory requirement that a patent's specification describe the invention "in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art" to "make and use" the invention. §112(a). Judges may no more subtract from the requirements for obtaining a patent that Congress has prescribed than they may add to them. See Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U.S. 593, 602-03, 612 (2010).

# III 

With these principles in mind, we return to claims 19 and 29 of the ' 165 patent and claim 7 of the ' 741 patent. In doing so, we do not doubt that Amgen's specification enables the 26 exemplary antibodies it identifies by their amino acid sequences. Even Sanofi concedes that description is enough to allow a person skilled in the art to make and use those embodiments. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 68. But the claims before us sweep much broader than those 26 antibodies. And we agree with the lower courts that Amgen has failed to enable all that it has claimed, even allowing for a reasonable degree of experimentation.

While the technology at the heart of this case is thoroughly modern, from the law's perspective Amgen's claims bear more than a passing resemblance to those this Court faced long ago in Morse, Incandescent Lamp, and Holland Furniture. Amgen seeks to monopolize an entire class of things defined by their function-every antibody that both binds to particular areas of the sweet spot of PCSK9 and blocks PCSK9 from binding to LDL receptors. The record reflects that this class of antibodies does not include just the 26 that Amgen has described by their amino acid sequences, but a "vast" number of additional antibodies that it has not. 987 F.3d, at 1085, 1088; see 2019 WL 4058927, *8 ("at least millions of candidates"); see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 52-53. Much as Morse sought to claim all telegraphic forms of communication, Sawyer and Man sought to claim all fibrous and textile materials for incandescence, and Perkins sought to claim all starch glues that work as well as animal glue for wood vencering, Amgen secks to claim "sovereignty over [an] entire kingdom" of antibodies. Incandescent Lamp, 159 U.S., at 476.

That poses Amgen with a challenge. For if our cases teach anything, it is that the more a party claims, the broader the monopoly it demands, the more it must enable. That holds true whether the case involves telegraphs devised in the 19th century, glues invented in the 20th, or antibody treatments developed in the 21 st. To be fair, Amgen does not dispute this much. It freely admits that it seeks to claim for itself an entire universe of antibodies. Still, it says, its broad claims are enabled because scientists can make and use every undisclosed but functional antibody if they simply follow the company's "roadmap" or its proposal for "conservative substitution."

We cannot agree. These two approaches amount to little more than two research assignments. The first merely describes step-by-step Amgen's own trial-and-error method for finding functional antibodies-calling on scientists to create a wide range of candidate antibodies and then screen each to see which happen to bind to PCSK9 in the right place and block it from binding to LDL receptors. The second isn't much different. It requires scientists to make substitutions to the amino acid sequences of antibodies known to work and then test the resulting antibodies to see if they do tooan uncertain prospect given the state of the art. Whether methods like a "roadmap" or "conservative substitution" might suffice to enable other claims in other patentsperhaps because, as this Court suggested in Incandescent Lamp, the inventor identifies a quality common to every functional embodiment-they do not here. They leave a scientist about where Sawyer and Man left Edison: forced to engage in "painstaking experimentation" to see what works. 159 U.S., at 475 . That is not enablement. More nearly, it is "a hunting license." Brenner v. Manson, 383 U.S. 519, 536 (1966).

Think about it this way. "Imagine a combination lock with 100 tumblers, each of which can be set to 20 different positions." Brief for Intellectual Property Law Professors and Scholars as Amici Curiae 20. "Through trial and error, imagine that an inventor finds and discloses 26 different successful lock combinations." But imagine, too, "that the inventor tries to claim much more, namely all successful combinations," while instructing others "to randomly try a large set of combinations and then record the successful ones." Sure enough, that kind of "roadmap" would produce functional combinations. But it would not enable others to make and use functional combinations; it would instead leave them to "random trial-and-error discovery." Like many analogies, this one may oversimplify a bit, but it captures the gist of the problem.

Failing in its primary argument that it has enabled all of the antibodies it claims, Amgen tries a few alternative lines of attack. First, it suggests that the Federal Circuit erred by applying an enablement test unmoored from the statutory text. As Amgen sees it, that court conflated the question whether an invention is enabled with the question how long may it take a person skilled in the art to make every embodiment within a broad claim. We do not see it that way. While we agree with Amgen that enablement is not measured against the cumulative time and effort it takes to make every embodiment within a claim, we are not so sure the Federal Circuit thought otherwise. That court went out of its way to say that it "do[es] not hold that the effort required to exhaust a genus is dispositive." 987 F.3d, at 1088 (emphasis deleted). Instead, the court stressed, the problem it saw is the same problem we see: Amgen offers persons skilled in the art little more than advice to engage in "trial and error." . . .

Finally, Amgen warns that an affirmance risks "destroy[ing] incentives for breakthrough inventions." But striking the proper balance between incentivizing inventors and ensuring the public receives the full benefit of their innovations is a policy judgment that belongs to Congress. Since 1790, Congress has included an enablement mandate as one feature among many designed to achieve the balance it wishes. Our only duty in this case lies in applying that mandate faithfully.

Section 112 of the Patent Act reflects Congress's judgment that if an inventor claims a lot, but enables only a little, the public does not receive its benefit of the bargain. For more than 150 years, this Court has enforced the statutory enablement requirement according to its terms. If the Court had not done so in Incandescent Lamp, it might have been writing decisions like Holland Furniture in the dark. Today's case may involve a new technology, but the legal principle is the same. The judgment is Affirmed.
# COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS 

1. Genus claims have long been a feature of patent law. Upholding the claims to Alexander Graham Bell's patent on the telephone, the Supreme Court observed that "a patent for such a discovery is not to be confined to the mere means he improvised to prove the reality of his conception." The Telephone Cases, 126 U.S. 1, 539 (1888). "It is enough if [the patentee] describes his method with sufficient clearness and precision to enable those skilled in the matter to understand what the process is, and if he points out some practicable way of putting it into operation." Id. at 536 (emphasis added). Quoting from a leading patent law treatise, the Court explained in another opinion that "the principle of the invention is a unit, and invariably the modes of its embodiment in a concrete invention may be numerous and in appearance very different from each other." Cont'l Paper Bag Co. v. E. Paper Bag Co., 210 U.S. 405, 419-20 (1908) (quoting 2 William Callyhan Robinson, The Law of Patents for Useful Inventions §485 (1890)). As the Court said in Tilghman v. Proctor:

Perhaps the process is susceptible of being applied in many modes and by the use of many forms of apparatus. The inventor is not bound to describe them all in order to secure to himself the exclusive right to the process, if he is really its inventor of discoverer. But he must describe some particular mode, or some apparatus, by which the process can be applied with at least some beneficial result, in order to show that it is capable of being exhibited and performed in actual experience.
102 U.S. 707, 728-29 (1880).
These cases recognize that genus claims are critical for meaningful patent protection. Without them, patentees face "the risk of an infringement being avoided" by a minor modification of the particular embodiments disclosed in the patent's specification.

Amgen required that patentees claiming broad genus claims enable the "full scope" of those claims. Is that likely to be possible for a genus that may encompass thousands or millions of examples? Several scholars have warned that genus claims are essentially impossible under the full scope standard, at least in the life sciences industries. See, e.g., Dmitry Karshtedt, et al., The Death of the Genus Claim, 35 Harv. J. L. \& Tech. 1 (2021). Should we be troubled by that? Perhaps that is just the cost of seeking broad claims. MagSil Corp., 687 F.3d at 1381 ("[A] patentee chooses broad claim language at the peril of losing any claim that cannot be enabled across its full scope of coverage.").

Professor Jeffrey Lefstin argues that most patent claims today actually cover a potentially infinite set of potential objects, particularly ones not yet conceived of. Jeffrey Lefstin, The Formal Structure of Patent Law and the Limits of Enablement, 23 Berkeley Tech. L.J. 1141, 1168 (2008). Does that mean those claims all fail the enablement requirement? Logically the answer should be yes. But it seems more likely that courts will distinguish between claims like those in Amgen and Holland Furniture that are written in functional terms (that is, to cover anything that performs the desired function) and those that define a group by some other characteristic (like the structure of a chemical). That won't help patent claims to antibodies; as the court notes, they seem to have little relationship between structure and function. But it may mean that simpler terms like "fastener" or "chair" in better-understood technologies will be held enabled even though they could in theory encompass an unlimited number of not-yet-identified embodiments.

Justice Gorsuch reasoned that Amgen's "roadmap" was little different from "a combination lock with 100 tumblers, each of which can be set to 20 different positions. Through trial and error, imagine that an inventor finds and discloses 26 different successful lock combinations," but the inventor claims "all successful combinations." Do you think that this is an apt analogy? Does it move a field forward to simply report that there are at least some successful candidates out there? If the knowledge that "some within this set of possible candidates will work" is very valuable, and if the cost of working out which candidates work is not too high, perhaps there is an economic argument that the disclosure is enabling. On the other hand, if the initial finding does little to assist in discovery of other successful candidates-e.g., if each random trial is just as likely (or unlikely) to succeed after the initial disclosure, and if the initial disclosure does not lower the cost of testing the next random candidate-then perhaps the genus is not enabled.
2. Divergence Between §102 Prior Art Enablement and §112 Full Scope Enablement. As noted in our discussion of §102, " [fj or a prior-art reference to be enabling, it need not enable the [challenged] claim in its entirety, but instead the reference need only enable a single embodiment of the claim." Agilent Technologies, Inc. v. Synthego Corp., --- F.4th ----2025 WL 1645693 (Fed. Cir. 2025) (quoting In re Morsa, 803 F.3d 1374, 1377 Fed. Cir. 2015); see also Schering Corp. v. Geneva Pharms., 339 F.3d 1373, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2003) ("An anticipatory reference need only enable subject matter that falls within the scope of the claims at issue, nothing more."). This divergence reflects the differing roles of §102 and §112. The former aims to ensure that patent claims do not cover prior art, whereas the latter seeks to ensure that patents fully enable skilled artisans to make and use the claimed invention without undue experimentation.
3. Person Having Ordinary Skill in the Art (PHOSITA) Standard. As we saw in Section (B)(2) on nonobviousness, patent law employs a hypothetical person, like tort law's reasonable person, in evaluating patentability. As one court has noted:

A patent specification is not addressed to judges or lawyers, but to those skilled in the art; it must be comprehensible to them, even though the unskilled may not be able to gather from it how to use the invention, and even if it is "all Greek" to the unskilled.
Gould v. Mossinghoff, 229 U.S.P.Q. 1 (D.D.C. 1985), aff'd in part, vacated in part sub nom. Gould v. Quigg, 822 F.2d 1074 (Fed. Cir. 1987).
4. Undue Experimentation Standard. How much would Sawyer and Man have to disclose to justify a patent on all vegetable and fibrous filaments in Incandescent Lamp? What if they had tested 100 filaments, and they had all worked about as well? The Federal Circuit in In re Wands, 858 F.2d 731 (Fed. Cir. 1988), established that enablement is tested by asking whether the person having ordinary skill in the art would be able to make and use all the species covered by the patent without "undue experimentation." The multi-factor test considers: (1) the quantity of experimentation necessary, (2) the amount of direction or guidance presented, (3) the presence or absence of working examples, (4) the nature of the invention, (5) the state of the prior art, (6) the relative skill of those in the art, (7) the predictability or unpredictability of the art, and (8) the breadth of the claims.

Sawyer and Man ![img-7.jpeg](img-7.jpeg)

Edison Thus, if Sawyer and Man had tested multiple fibrous filaments and found that they generally worked, that might justify a claim to the genus, even though it turned out that some worked quite well and some did not work at all. The problem with their broad genus claim was two-fold: (1) they did not do that testing; and (2) if they had, it would not have shown that vegetable and fibrous material was a meaningful class of filaments with similar characteristics.
5. Of what relevance, if any, is it that Edison's research resulted in several patents of his own? Does the fact that inventor A received a patent suggest anything about whether A 's research results are enabled by the specification of a prior patent issued to B ?

As a doctrinal matter, Edison's patents should be irrelevant to the validity of Sawyer and Man's. It is not only possible but common for A to invent something and for B to improve it. Think of the pencil, for example. The inventor of the pencil could patent that idea. A later inventor who comes up with the idea of attaching an craser to the pencil would be entitled to their own patent on the pencil + craser combination. Those patents are said to "block" each other; neither A nor B can make a pencil with an craser without infringing the other's rights. On the economics of blocking patents, see Robert P.
Merges, Intellectual Property Rights and Bargaining Breakdown: The Case of Blocking Patents, 62 TENN. L. REV. 75 (1994).
6. The Amgen Court devotes substantial attention to the Court's 1853 case involving Samuel F.B. Morse's invention of the telegraph. That patent included eight claims, the first seven of which-relating the particular machinery for propagating signals through electrical wires and Morse code-were not at issue. The Court's seminal enablement decision related to Morse's eighth claim:

I do not propose to limit myself to the specific machinery, or parts of machinery, described in the foregoing specifications and claims; the essence of my invention being the use of the motive power of the electric or galvanic current, which I call electro-magnetism, however developed, for making or printing intelligible characters, letters, or signs, at any distances, being a new application of that power, of which I claim to be the first inventor or discovered.'
Here is how the Court explained its rejection of the eighth claim:
It is impossible to misunderstand the extent of this claim. [Morse] claims the exclusive right to every improvement where the motive power is the electric or galvanic current, and the result is the marking or printing intelligible characters, signs, or letters at a distance.

If this claim can be maintained, it matters not by what process or machinery the result is accomplished. For aught that we now know, some future inventor, in the onward march of science, may discover a mode of writing or printing at a distance by means of the electric or galvanic current, without using any part of the process or combination set forth in the plaintiff's specification. His invention may be less complicated-less liable to get out of order-less expensive in construction, and in its operation. But yet if it is covered by this patent, the inventor could not use it, nor the public have the benefit of it, without the permission of this patentee.

Nor is this all; while he shuts the door against inventions of other persons. the patentee would be able to avail himself of new discoveries in the properties and powers of electro-magnetism which scientific men might bring to light. For he says he does not confine his claim to the machinery or parts of machinery which he specifies, but claims for himself a monopoly in its use, however developed, for the purpose of printing at a distance. New discoveries in physical science may enable him to combine it with new agents and new elements, and by that means attain the object in a manner superior to the present process and altogether different from it. And if he can secure the exclusive use by his present patent, he may vary it with every new discovery and development of the science, and need place no description of the new manner, process, or machinery upon the records of the patent office. And when his patent expires, the public must apply to him to learn what it is. In fine, he claims an exclusive right to use a manner and process which he has not described and indeed had not invented, and therefore could not describe when he obtained his patent. The court is of opinion that the claim is too broad, and not warranted by law.
O'Reilly v. Morse, 56 U.S. 62, 112-13 (1853).
The Court in Morse placed particular emphasis on Neilson v. Harford, a prominent English court decision involving another industrial revolution breakthrough: a method for improving the functioning of hot blast furnaces by heating air before injecting it into the receptacle. Like Morse, Neilson claimed this breakthrough in broad terms. But unlike in Morse, the Court of the Exchequer upheld the broad claim.
![img-8.jpeg](img-8.jpeg)

Neilson's Hot Blast Furnace (1829)
What distinguishes Morse's broad eighth claim, which the Court invalidated, from Neilson's broad claim, which the Court of Exchequer upheld?

Morse quotes Baron Parke stating that It is very difficult to distinguish [Neilson's patent] from the specification of a patent for a principle, and this at first created in the minds of the court much difficulty, but after full consideration we think that the plaintiff does not merely claim a principle, but a machine embodying a principle, and a very valuable one. We think the case must be considered as if, the principle being well known, the plaintiff had first invented a mode of applying it by a mechanical apparatus to furnaces, and his invention then consists in this: by interposing a receptacle for heated air between the blowing apparatus and the furnace.
Neilson v. Harford, 1 Web. P. C. 295, 371 (1841) (emphasis added), quoted in O'Reilly v. Morse, 56 U.S. at 115 . Morse then explains:

Neilson, in his specification, described his invention as one for the improved application of air to produce heat in fires, forges, and furnaces where a blowing apparatus is required. And it was to be applied as follows: the blast or current of air produced by the blowing apparatus was to be passed from it into an air vessel or receptacle made sufficiently strong to endure the blast, and through or from that vessel or receptacle by means of a tube, pipe, or aperture into the fire, the receptacle be kept artificially heated to a considerable temperature by heat externally applied. He then described in rather general terms the manner in which the receptacle might be constructed and heated and the air conducted through it to the fire, stating that the form of the receptacle was not material nor the manner of applying heat to it. In the action above-mentioned for the infringement of this patent, the defendant, among other defenses, insisted that the machinery for heating the air and throwing it hot into the furnace was not sufficiently described in the specification, and the patent void on that account-and also, that a patent for throwing hot air into the furnace instead of cold, and thereby increasing the intensity of the heat, was a patent for a principle, and that a principle was not patentable.

Undoubtedly, the principle that hot air will promote the ignition of fuel better than cold, was embodied in this machine. But the patent was not supported because this principle was embodied in it. He would have been equally entitled to a patent, if he had invented an improvement in the mechanical arrangements of the blowing apparatus, or in the furnace, while a cold current of air was still used. But his patent was supported, because he had invented a mechanical apparatus, by which a current of hot air, instead of cold, could be thrown in. And this new method was protected by his patent. The interposition of a heated receptacle, in any form, was the novelty he invented.

We do not perceive how the claim in the case before us, can derive any countenance from this decision. If the Court of Exchequer had said that Neilson's patent was for the discovery, that hot air would promote ignition better than cold, and that he had an exclusive right to use it for that purpose, there might, perhaps, have been some reason to rely upon it. But the court emphatically denied this right to such a patent. And his claim, as the patent was construed and supported by the court, is altogether unlike that of the patentee before us.

For Neilson discovered, that by interposing a heated receptacle between the blower and the furnace, and conducting the current of air through it, the heat in the furnace was increased. And this effect was always produced, whatever might be the form of the receptacle, or the mechanical contrivances for heating it, or for passing the current of air through it, and into the furnace.

But Professor Morse has not discovered, that the electric or galvanic current will always print at a distance, no matter what may be the form of the machinery or mechanical contrivances through which it passes. You may use electromagnetism as a motive power, and yet not produce the described effect, that is, print at a distance intelligible marks or signs. To produce that effect, it must be combined with, and passed through, and operate upon, certain complicated and delicate machinery, adjusted and arranged upon philosophical principles, and prepared by the highest mechanical skill. And it is the high praise of Professor Morse, that he has been able, by a new combination of known powers, of which electro-magnetism is one, to discover a method by which intelligible marks or signs may be printed at a distance. And for the method or process thus discovered, he is entitled to a patent. But he has not discovered that the electromagnetic current, used as motive power, in any other method, and with any other combination, will do as well.
Id. at 114-17.
Professor Jeffrey Lefstin explains why the English Court treated Neilson's discovery as "being well known":

Considering the principle to have "an anterior existence"-being well knownwas a way to rationalize dedicating the patentee's underlying discovery to the public. Baron Alderson was attempting to reconcile the legal doctrine that the abstract principle behind the invention was not patentable with the recognition that the discovery of the principle may have been the real 'invention' by the patentee. This is not a paradox for modern patent doctrine founded on the peripheral claim. The inventor's creation and the scope of patent protection are ontologically quite distinct. But in a time where 'invention' and 'scope of protection' were essentially synonymous, it was necessary to explain how an inventor who had discovered a new principle was nonetheless not entitled to claim it. Treating the principle as having an anterior existence was a way to assess whether the patentee was claiming a principle in the abstract or a mode of practically applying that principle.
Jeffrey A. Lefstin, Inventive Application: A History, 67 Fla. L. Rev. 565, 583 (2015). As we will see in Section B(5) dealing with eligible subject matter, patent law has long excluded patents on laws of nature in the abstract. Neilson and Morse figure prominently in that jurisprudence.

Why was Morse's specification inadequate to support his eighth claim? What if he had also taught the use of electromagnetism to communicate sounds (as telephones do)? Would the claim still be too broad? What more would Morse have had to show to justify that claim? And what of the fact that many uses of electromagnetism would not succeed in communicating at a distance? Morse had only developed a method of opening and closing an electrical circuit and amplifying the signal. Or is there nonetheless a sense in which the claim is too broad and abstract regardless of how many examples Morse taught? Do we really want someone-even a pioneering inventor like Morse-to own the concept of communication at a distance?
7. The Amgen Court treats Morse as an enablement case. But the Court has also treated Morse as involving unpatentable "abstract ideas" under the doctrine of patentable subject matter. At the time Morse was decided, the same statutory provision created both requirements. One way to think about the question is to ask whether the problem was just that Morse didn't teach enough to enable people to practice his invention or whether the problem is that the claim is too broad no matter what he taught. If the problem is the former, the issue is enablement, and presumably Morse could have given enough information to justify such a claim. If the issue is the latter, that may be better thought of as a limit on patentable subject matter.
# PROBLEM III-8 

Suppose William Schrafft received a patent claiming "all food-based flavors" of jelly beans. In his specification, he discloses his method for manufacturing lemon and raspberry varictics. Several years later, during the patent's life, the wizard Bertie Bott (from the Harry Potter series) was experimenting with confections when a pair of dirty socks fell into his concoction. Recognizing the sales potential of sweets that present a "risk with every mouthful," he introduces "Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans," which includes "Bogey," "Dirt," "Dirty Sock," "Earthworm," "Earwax," "Envelope Glue," "Phlegm," "Soap," and "Vomit," as well as a broad range of more appetizing flavorsincluding cherry, lemon, and kale (well, maybe not so appetizing). Can Bertie Bott successfully challenge or circumvent Schrafft's claim? How would you structure the analysis?

## ii. The Written Description Requirement

In addition to the enablement requirement, a series of cases developed the notion that §112 (a) added a "written description" requirement. Originally seen as a doctrine that applied only when claims were amended during prosecution, it has been expanded to form an integral component of the law of patent disclosure. The basic standard is stated clearly enough in the cases: as of the application filing date, the applicant must show the inventor was "in possession" of the invention as later claimed. Courts compare the original disclosure with the final claims of an issued patent and ask whether the applicant signified that the specific features and embodiments later claimed were in fact important aspects of the invention. As it has evolved, the doctrine has become a way to prevent applicants from claiming subject matter they were not themselves yet aware of, even if skilled artisans could have gleaned it from the patent specification.

The written description doctrine is more restrictive than the enablement requirement. That is, claims that meet the enablement test do not necessarily meet the written description test. See, e.g., Amgen Inc. v. Hoechst Marion Roussel, Inc., 314 F.3d 1313, 1334 (Fed. Cir. 2003) ("The enablement requirement is often more indulgent than the written description requirement. The specification need not explicitly teach those in the art to make and use the invention; the requirement is satisfied if, given what they already know, the specification teaches those in the art enough that they can make and use the invention without 'undue experimentation."'). For example, a patent's disclosure may teach about a certain group of embodiments sufficiently that they can be made without "undue experimentation" under The Incandescent Lamp Patent, and yet not single out a specific feature that later appears in a claim, thereby failing the written description requirement.

In recent years, courts have also used written description to test for claim overbreadth in a manner quite reminiscent of the classic enablement test. See Dennis Crouch, An Empirical Study of the Role of the Written Description Requirement in Patent Examination, 104 NW. U. L. REV. 1665, 1667-68 (2010) (citing studies showing that most written description cases could also be decided on enablement grounds, and finding that in patent appeals at the PTO, written description was almost never used as a ground of invalidity).

There are two classes of cases, however, where written description does additional work beyond enablement: (1) Opportunistic Claiming-where the patentee has filed an enabling continuation claim after seeing the competition's product; and (2) Gun-Jumping-where the patentee has filed an enabling patent claim before they have sufficient support.

# The Gentry Gallery, Inc. v. The Berkline Corp. 
United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit 
134 F.3d 1473 (Fed. Cir. 1998)

LOURIE, CIRCUIT JUDGE.
The Gentry Gallery appeals from the judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts holding that the Berkline Corporation does not infringe U.S. Patent 5,064,244, and declining to award attorney fees for Gentry's defense to Berkline's assertion that the patent was unenforceable. . . . Berkline cross-appeals from the decision that the patent was not shown to be invalid. . . [B]ecause the court clearly erred in finding that the written description portion of the specification supported certain of the broader claims asserted by Gentry, we reverse the decision that those claims are not invalid under 35 U.S.C. §112,****1 (1994).

# Background 

Gentry owns the '244 patent, which is directed to a unit of a sectional sofa in which two independent reclining seats ("recliners") face in the same direction. Sectional sofas are typically organized in an L-shape with "arms" at the exposed ends of the linear sections. According to the patent specification, because recliners usually have had adjustment controls on their arms, sectional sofas were able to contain two recliners only if they were located at the exposed ends of the linear sections. Due to the typical L-shaped configuration of sectional sofas, the recliners therefore faced in different directions. See '244 patent; col. 1, 11. 15-19. Such an arrangement was "not usually comfortable when the occupants are watching television because one or both occupants must turn their heads to watch the same [television] set. Furthermore, the separation of the two reclining seats at opposite ends of a sectional sofa is not comfortable or conducive to intimate conversation." Id. at col. 1, 11. 19-25.

The invention of the patent solved this supposed dilemma by, inter alia, placing a "console" between two recliners which face in the same direction. This console "accommodates the controls for both reclining seats," thus eliminating the need to position each recliner at an exposed end of a linear section. Id. at col. 1, 11. 36-37. Accordingly, both recliners can then be located on the same linear section allowing two people to recline while watching television and facing in the same direction. Claim 1, which is the broadest claim of the patent, reads in relevant part:

A sectional sofa comprising:
a pair of reclining seats disposed in parallel relationship with one another in a double reclining seat sectional sofa section being without an arm at one end..., each of said reclining seats having a backrest and seat cushions and movable between upright and reclined positions..., a fixed console disposed in the double reclining seat sofa section between the pair of reclining seats and with the console and reclining seats together comprising a unitary structure, said console including an armrest portion for each of the reclining seats; said arm rests remaining fixed when the reclining seats move from one to another of their positions, and a pair of control means, one for each reclining seat, mounted on the double reclining seat sofa section. . . .
Id. at col. 4 , line 68 to col. 5, 11. 1-27 (emphasis added to most relevant claim language). Claims 9,10,12-15, and 19-21 are directed to a sectional sofa in which the control means are specifically located on the console.
![img-9.jpeg](img-9.jpeg)

Patent drawing for the Gentry '244 patent.
In 1991, Gentry filed suit ... alleging that Berkline infringed the patent by manufacturing and selling sectional sofas having two recliners facing in the same direction. In the allegedly infringing sofas, the recliners were separated by a seat which has a back cushion that may be pivoted down onto the seat, so that the seat back may serve as a tabletop between the recliners.... The district court granted Berkline's motion for summary judgment of non-infringement, but denied its motions for summary judgment of invalidity and unenforceability.

# Discussion 

## B. Invalidity

Berkline . . . argues that claims 1-8,11, and 16-18 are invalid because they are directed to sectional sofas in which the location of the recliner controls is not limited to the console. According to Berkline, because the patent only describes sofas having controls on the console and an object of the invention is to provide a sectional sofa "with a console . . . that accommodates the controls for both the reclining seats," ' 244 patent, col. 1, 11. 35-37, the claimed sofas are not described within the meaning of §112,****. Berkline also relies on Sproule's testimony that "locating the controls on the console is definitely the way we solved it [the problem of building sectional sofa with parallel recliners] on the original group [of sofas]." Gentry responds that the disclosure represents only Sproule's preferred embodiment, in which the controls are on the console, and therefore supports claims directed to a sofa in which the controls may be located elsewhere. Gentry relies on Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. v. United States Surgical Corp., 93 F.3d 1572, 1582 n. 7 (Fed. Cir. 1993), and In re Rasmussen, 650 F.2d 1212, 1214 (CCPA 1981), for the proposition that an applicant need not describe more than one embodiment of a broad claim to adequately support that claim.

We agree with Berkline that the patent's disclosure does not support claims in which the location of the recliner controls is other than on the console. Whether a specification complies with the written description requirement of §112,****, is a question of fact, which we review for clear error on appeal from a bench trial. See Vas-Cath Inc. v. Mahurkar, 935 F.2d 1555, 1563 (Fed. Cir. 1991). To fulfill the written description requirement, the patent specification "must clearly allow persons of ordinary skill in the art to recognize that [the inventor] invented what is claimed." In re Gosteli, 872 F.2d 1008, 1012 (Fed. Cir. 1989). An applicant complies with the written description requirement "by describing the invention, with all its claimed limitations." Lockwood v. American Airlines, Inc., 107 F.3d 1565, 1572 (Fed. Cir. 1997).

It is a truism that a claim need not be limited to a preferred embodiment. However, in a given case, the scope of the right to exclude may be limited by a narrow disclosure. For example, as we have recently held, a disclosure of a television set with a keypad, connected to a central computer with a video disk player did not support claims directed to "an individual terminal containing a video disk player." See id. (stating that claims directed to a "distinct invention from that disclosed in the specification" do not satisfy the written description requirement); see also Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Eli Lilly \& Co., 119 F.3d 1559, 1568 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (stating that the case law does "not compel the conclusion that a description of a species always constitutes a description of a genus of which it is a part").

In this case, the original disclosure clearly identifies the console as the only possible location for the controls. It provides for only the most minor variation in the location of the controls, noting that the control "may be mounted on top or side surfaces of the console rather than on the front wall . . . without departing from this invention." ' 244 patent, col. 2, line 68 to col. 3, line 3. No similar variation beyond the console is even suggested. Additionally, the only discernible purpose for the console is to house the controls. As the disclosure states, identifying the only purpose relevant to the console, "[a]nother object of the present invention is to provide . . . a console positioned between [the reclining seats] that accommodates the controls for both of the reclining seats." Id. at col. 1, 11. 33-37. Thus, locating the controls anywhere but on the console is outside the stated purpose of the invention. Moreover, consistent with this disclosure, Sproule's broadest original claim was directed to a sofa comprising, inter alia, "control means located upon the center console to enable each of the pair of reclining seats to move separately between the reclined and upright positions." Finally, although not dispositive, because one can add claims to a pending application directed to adequately described subject matter, Sproule admitted at trial that he did not consider placing the controls outside the console until he became aware that some of Gentry's competitors were so locating the recliner controls. Accordingly, when viewed in its entirety, the disclosure is limited to sofas in which the recliner control is located on the console.

Gentry's reliance on Ethicon is misplaced. It is true, as Gentry observes, that we noted that "an applicant . . . is generally allowed claims, when the art permits, which cover more than the specific embodiment shown." Ethicon, 93 F.3d at 1582 n. 7 (quoting In re Vickers, 141 F.2d 522, 525 (CCPA 1944)). However, we were also careful to point out in that opinion that the applicant "was free to draft claim[s] broadly (within the limits imposed by the prior art) to exclude the lockout precise location as a limitation of the claimed invention" only because he "did not consider the precise location of the lockout to be an element of his invention." Id. Here, as indicated above, it is clear that Sproule considered the location of the recliner controls on the console to be an essential element of his invention. Accordingly, his original disclosure serves to limit the permissible breadth of his later-drafted claims.

Similarly, In re Rasmussen does not support Gentry's position. In that case, our predecessor court restated the uncontroversial proposition that "a claim may be broader than the specific embodiment disclosed in a specification." 650 F.2d at 1215 . However, the court also made clear that "[a]n applicant is entitled to claims as broad as the prior art and his disclosure will allow." Id. at 1214 (emphasis added). The claims at issue in Rasmussen, which were limited to the generic step of "adheringly applying" one layer to an adjacent layer, satisfied the written description requirement only because "one skilled in the art who read [the] specification would understand that it is unimportant how the layers are adhered, so long as they are adhered." Here, on the contrary, one skilled in the art would clearly understand that it was not only important, but essential to Sproule's invention, for the controls to be on the console.

In sum, the cases on which Gentry relics do not stand for the proposition that an applicant can broaden his claims to the extent that they are effectively bounded only by the prior art. Rather, they make clear that claims may be no broader than the supporting disclosure, and therefore that a narrow disclosure will limit claim breadth. Here, Sproule's disclosure unambiguously limited the location of the controls to the console. Accordingly, the district court clearly erred in finding that he was entitled to claims in which the recliner controls are not located on the console. We therefore reverse the judgment that claims 1-8,11, and 16-18, were not shown to be invalid.

# COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS 

1. Do you see why Gentry Gallery is an opportunistic claiming case? What would have happened if the patentee had filed its broader amended claim in the first place, before it ever saw the defendant's product?
2. Critique of the Written Description Doctrine. Does it make sense to have both an enablement requirement and a written description requirement? If the inventor must teach one of ordinary skill in the art how to make and use the invention, why require them to write down the exact invention as well? Cf. Moba v. Diamond Automation, Inc., 325 F.3d 1306, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (Rader, J., dissenting) ("Under Federal Circuit case law, [the plaintiff in this case] asked the jury to decide that the patent's disclosure can enable a skilled artisan to make and practice the entire invention, but still not inform that same artisan that the inventor was in possession of the invention. Perplexing."); see Harris A. Pitlick, The Mutation on the Description Requirement Gene, 80 J. Pat. \& TRADEMARK OFF. SOC'Y 209, 222 (1998) (written description cases are "an unmitigated disaster"); Laurence H. Pretty, The Recline and Fall of Mechanical Genus Claim Scope Under "Written Description" in the Sofa Case, 80 J. Pat. \& Trademark Off. Soc'y 469 (1998). Can enablement do the work written description currently does? See Robert P. Merges, Software and Patent Scope: A Report from the Middle Innings, 85 Tex. L. REV. 1627 (2007) (describing Gentry Gallery as an example of "misappropriation by claim amendment," and suggesting that it could have been decided on enablement, not written description, grounds).
3. Defense of the Written Description Doctrine. The separate requirement of adequate written description has been defended on the ground that enablement doctrine is incapable of defining meaningful limits to claim scope. See Jeffrey A. Lefstin, The Formal Structure of Patent Law and the Limits of Enablement, 23 BERKELEY TECH. L.J. 1141 (2008). Professor Lefstin argues that almost every claim includes in theory an infinite number of embodiments, so that no specification actually teaches how to make all or substantially all claimed embodiments. Written description steps in at this point; its requirement that embodiments be actually described resolves the logical deficiencies of enablement doctrine. Written description, properly understood, is a doctrine of definition. One might respond that it is the rigid logic of contemporary enablement doctrine that creates this need, and that an alternative to written description is a relaxing of these doctrinal rigidities-a fix from "within" enablement, which would dispense with the need for a separate doctrine. But for Professor Lefstin, the problem is inherent in the effort to draft a claim to cover a universe of actual and potential embodiments.
4. Biotechnology Claims and Gun-Jumping. The application of the written description requirement to biotechnology claims has been a particularly controversial issue. A number of cases beginning in the late 1990s required inventors to disclose specific gene sequences to claim them, even when functional properties of a gene (such as the protein it codes for) were already known. See Regents of the University of California v. Eli Lilly \& Co., 119 F.3d 1559 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (claims covering gene sequence for human insulin invalidated under written description requirement, where specification disclosed only sequence of rat insulin); Janice M. Mueller, The Evolving Application of the Written Description Requirement to Biotechnological Inventions, 13 Berkeley Tech. L.J. 615 (1998). If Gentry Gallery and its ilk were about late claiming -trying to change the patent to cover things the inventor had not in fact thought ofthe biotechnology cases are about "gun-jumping" -leaving the gate before the starter has fired the pistol. The patent race motivates inventors to lay claim to an invention at the earliest possible moment, and sometimes before it is the inventor's grasp. As we have seen, this same concern arises with regard to the utility requirement, discussed in Chapter III(B)(5).
5. The Separate Written Description Requirement. In Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Eli Lilly \& Co., 598 F.3d 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (en banc), the Federal Circuit established unequivocally that the written description requirement of §112(a) is separate from enablement. The court based its analysis on a close but controversial textual reading analysis of §112(a), focusing on punctuation and the placement of "and" connectors, as well as precedent, see Schriber-Schroth Co. v. Cleveland Trust Co., 305 U.S. 47, 56-57 (1938); Vas-Cath Inc. v. Mahurkar, 935 F.2d 1555, 1562-63 (Fed Cir. 1991).

Ariad clarifies application of the doctrine. The specification must clearly demonstrate to a PHOSITA that the inventor possessed what is claimed as of the filing date. It is a question of fact that depends on the context: nature and scope of the claims; complexity and predictability of relevant technology; extent and content of the prior art; maturity of the science or technology. The requirement has particular relevance to genus claims so as to ensure that the scope is commensurate with the invention. Notably, the Federal Circuit denied that "possession" itself was the touchstone for written description, though it did not articulate an alternative formulation.

The court's application of the test to a breakthrough biotechnology discovery emphasized the "gun-jumping" analysis. The invention at issue was made in a new and unpredictable field. And although Ariad had hypothesized three classes of molecules potentially capable of achieving its broad claim of reducing NF-kB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) activity, the disclosure was more in the nature of a research plan: Ariad had not actually produced any of those molecules at the time it filed its patent application. Notwithstanding that Ariad's conjectures were ultimately borne out, the court ruled that Ariad was not adequately in possession of the necessary knowledge at the time that they filed their application. A key figure in the file which established the effects was not disclosed until two years after the application date. Ariad sought to salvage the patent by arguing that a PHOSITA could have achieved the result based on the original specification through experimentation. The court concluded, however, that " [i]n the context of this invention, a vague functional description and invitation for further research does not constitute written description of a specific inhibitor [molecule]."

# iii. Best Mode 

The best mode requirement was established as a safeguard against incomplete disclosure of the most effective ways of practicing the invention. The requirement does not permit inventors to hold back their preferred method or embodiment from their disclosure. In re Nelson, 280 F.2d 172 (CCPA 1960).

The AIA substantially curtailed the significance of the best mode requirement by eliminating failure to disclose best mode as a basis for invalidating a patent claim. Nonetheless, the best mode requirement remains theoretically applicable in patent examination. See MANUAL OF PATENT EXAMINING PROCEDURE (MPEP) §2165. It is difficult, however, for an examiner to police this requirement.

## PROBLEM III-9

Slice-O-Rama is a company that makes food preparation items, including cheese slicers. It owns a U.S. patent covering a cheese slicer with a novel twist: The cutting element is a wire, which can be stretched between an end point and a handle. The slicer is well-received by the public and is even the subject of a national design award. One element in the claim calls for "a cutting wire" stretched between a handle and a fixed point on the base of the cutting element arm.

Cheese Slicer Patent Drawing OmniCorp is a large conglomerate with numerous divisions in various industries. One division, BigChem, Inc., is in the business of developing and manufacturing plastics. In the wake of research on new plastics, BigChem has come up with a plastic that is capable of holding a sharp cutting edge. Deemed "sharpylene," it can be manufactured in a variety of thicknesses, including a very thin version that looks like a wire or piece of string. As part of an internal initiative to encourage various divisions of OmniCorp to work more closely, Fran Fromage, product manager for the food processor and blender product lines in OmniCorp's FoodMulch division, comes across a sample of the BigChem plastic. Being familiar with the popularity of the Slice-O-Rama cheese slicer, she hits on the idea of substituting BigChem's new plastic in place of the metal wire. She believes that this cheese slicer would be an important addition to the FoodMulch product line. She is aware of the Slice-O-Rama patent, but as she puts it, "how can that patent stop us from selling blades made from plastic that we invented?! Those folks over at Slice-O-Rama have never even heard of sharpylene!"

You are a member of the patent department at OmniCorp. Assuming that the FoodMulch cheese slicer will meet all limitations other than the "cutting wire" element in the Slice-O-Rama patent, how would you advise Ms. Fromage?
