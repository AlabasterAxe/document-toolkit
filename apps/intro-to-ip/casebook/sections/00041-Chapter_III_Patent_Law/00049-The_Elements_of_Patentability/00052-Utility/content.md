Section 101 provides that "[w]hoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor . . " This is the textual basis for the utility requirement.

At first glance, utility might seem a simple requirement to apply. After all, whether or not something is useful is typically easy to determine. Nonetheless, there are a few areas in which utility is questionable. Chemists often synthesize compounds that they believe might be useful someday but for which no particular use is known or a potential use is highly speculative at the time that they file their patent application. Should they be entitled to a patent before that utility is known?

## Brenner v. Manson Supreme Court of the United States 383 U.S. 519 (1966)

Mr. JUSTICE FORTAS delivered the opinion of the Court.
A Patent Office examiner denied Manson's application, and the denial was affirmed by the Board of Appeals within the Patent Office. The ground for rejection was the failure "to disclose any utility for" the chemical compound produced by the process. This omission was not cured, in the opinion of the Patent Office, by Manson's reference to an article in the November 1956 issue of the Journal of Organic Chemistry, 21 J. ORG. CHEM. 1333-1335, which revealed that steroids of a class which included the compound in question were undergoing screening for possible tumor-inhibiting effects in mice, and that a homologue ^3 adjacent to Manson's steroid had proven effective in that role. Said the Board of Appeals, "It is our view that the statutory requirement of usefulness of a product cannot be presumed merely because it happens to be closely related to another compound which is known to be useful."

The Court of Customs and Patent Appeals (hereinafter CCPA) reversed[, stating] "where a claimed process produces a known product it is not necessary to show utility for the product," so long as the product "is not alleged to be detrimental to the public interest."

Our starting point is the proposition, neither disputed nor disputable, that one may patent only that which is "useful." [T]he concept of utility has maintained a central place in all of our patent legislation, beginning with the first patent law in 1790 and culminating in the present [§101]...

Respondent does not—at least in the first instance—rest upon the extreme proposition, advanced by the court below, that a novel chemical process is patentable so long as it yields the intended product and so long as the product is not itself "detrimental." Nor does he commit the outcome of his claim to the slightly more conventional proposition that any process is "useful" within the meaning of §101 if it produces a compound whose potential usefulness is under investigation by serious scientific researchers, although he urges this position, too, as an alternative basis for affirming the decision. Rather, he begins with the much more orthodox argument that his process has a specific utility which would entitle him to a declaration of interference even under the Patent Office's reading of §101. The claim is that the supporting affidavits, by reference to Ringold's 1956 article, reveal that an adjacent homologue of the steroid yielded by his process has been demonstrated to have tumor-inhibiting effects in mice, and that this discloses the requisite utility. We do not accept any of these theories as an adequate basis for overriding the determination of the Patent Office that the "utility" requirement has not been met.

Even on the assumption that the process would be patentable were respondent to show that the steroid produced had a tumor-inhibiting effect in mice, we would not overrule the Patent Office finding that respondent has not made such a showing. The Patent Office held that, despite the reference to the adjacent homologue, respondent's papers did not disclose a sufficient likelihood that the steroid yielded by his process would have similar tumor-inhibiting characteristics. Indeed, respondent himself recognized that the presumption that adjacent homologues have the same utility has been challenged in the steroid field because of "a greater known unpredictability of compounds in that field." In these circumstances and in this technical area, we would not overturn the finding of the Primary Examiner, affirmed by the Board of Appeals and not challenged by the CCPA.

The second and third points of respondent's argument present issues of much importance. Is a chemical process "useful" within the meaning of §101 either (1) because it works—i.e., produces the intended product? or (2) because the compound yielded belongs to a class of compounds now the subject of serious scientific investigation? These contentions present the basic problem for our adjudication. Since we find no specific assistance in the legislative materials underlying §101, we are remitted to an analysis of the problem in light of the general intent of Congress, the purposes of the patent system, and the implications of a decision one way or the other.

In support of his plea that we attenuate the requirement of "utility," respondent relies upon Justice Story's well-known statement that a "useful" invention is one "which may be applied to a beneficial use in society, in contradistinction to an invention injurious to the morals, health, or good order of society, or frivolous and insignificant"20-and upon the assertion that to do so would encourage inventors of new processes to publicize the event for the benefit of the entire scientific community, thus widening the search for uses and increasing the fund of scientific knowledge. Justice Story's language sheds little light on our subject. Narrowly read, it does no more than compel us to decide whether the invention in question is "frivolous and insignificant"-a query no easier of application than the one built into the statute. Read more broadly, so as to allow the patenting of any invention not positively harmful to society, it places such a special meaning on the word "useful" that we cannot accept it in the absence of evidence that Congress so intended. There are, after all, many things in this world which may not be considered "useful" but which, nevertheless, are totally without a capacity for harm.

Whatever weight is attached to the value of encouraging disclosure and of inhibiting secrecy, we believe a more compelling consideration is that a process patent in the chemical field, which has not been developed and pointed to the degree of specific utility, creates a monopoly of knowledge which should be granted only if clearly commanded by the statute. Until the process claim has been reduced to production of a product shown to be useful, the metes and bounds of that monopoly are not capable of precise delineation. It may engross a vast, unknown, and perhaps unknowable area. Such a patent may confer power to block off whole areas of scientific development, without compensating benefit to the public. The basic quid pro quo contemplated by the Constitution and the Congress for granting a patent monopoly is the benefit derived by the public from an invention with substantial utility. Unless and until a process is refined and developed to this point-where specific benefit exists in currently available formthere is insufficient justification for permitting an applicant to engross what may prove to be a broad field.

These arguments for and against the patentability of a process which either has no known use or is useful only in the sense that it may be an object of scientific research would apply equally to the patenting of the product produced by the process. Respondent appears to concede that with respect to a product, as opposed to a process, Congress has struck the balance on the side of nonpatentability unless "utility" is shown. Indeed, the decisions of the CCPA are in accord with the view that a product may not be patented absent a showing of utility greater than any adduced in the present case. We find absolutely no warrant for the proposition that although Congress intended that no patent be granted on a chemical compound whose sole "utility" consists of its potential role as an object of use-testing, a different set of rules was meant to apply to the process which yielded the unpatentable product. That proposition seems to us little more than an attempt to evade the impact of the rules which concededly govern patentability of the product itself.

This is not to say that we mean to disparage the importance of contributions to the fund of scientific information short of the invention of something "useful," or that we are blind to the prospect that what now seems without "use" may tomorrow command the grateful attention of the public. But a patent is not a hunting license. It is not a reward for the search, but compensation for its successful conclusion. "[A] patent system must be related to the world of commerce rather than to the realm of philosophy. . . ."

The judgment of the CCPA is Reversed.
Mr. Justice Harlan, concurring in part and dissenting in part:
... Because I believe that the Court's policy arguments are not convincing and that past practice favors the respondent, I would reject the narrow definition of "useful" and uphold the judgment of the CCPA.

The Court's opinion sets out about half a dozen reasons in support of its interpretation. Several of these arguments seem to me to have almost no force. For instance, it is suggested that "[u]ntil the process claim has been reduced to production of a product shown to be useful, the metes and bounds of that monopoly are not capable of precise delineation" and "[i]t may engross a vast, unknown, and perhaps unknowable area." I fail to see the relevance of these assertions; process claims are not disallowed because the products they produce may be of "vast" importance nor, in any event, does advance knowledge of a specific product use provide much safeguard on this score or fix "metes and bounds" precisely since a hundred more uses may be found after a patent is granted and greatly enhance its value. . . .

More to the point, I think, are the Court's remaining, prudential arguments against patentability: namely, that disclosure induced by allowing a patent is partly undercut by patent-application drafting techniques, that disclosure may occur without granting a patent, and that a patent will discourage others from inventing uses for the product. How far opaque drafting may lessen the public benefits resulting from the issuance of a patent is not shown by any evidence in this case but, more important, the argument operates against all patents and gives no reason for singling out the class involved here. The thought that these inventions may be more likely than most to be disclosed even if patents are not allowed may have more force; but while empirical study of the industry might reveal that chemical researchers would behave in this fashion, the abstractly logical choice for them seems to me to maintain secrecy until a product use can be discovered. As to discouraging the search by others for product uses, there is no doubt this risk exists but the price paid for any patent is that research on other uses or improvements may be hampered because the original patentee will reap much of the reward. From the standpoint of the public interest the Constitution seems to have resolved that choice in favor of patentability.
What I find most troubling about the result reached by the Court is the impact it may have on chemical research. Chemistry is a highly interrelated field and a tangible benefit for society may be the outcome of a number of different discoveries, one discovery building upon the next. To encourage one chemist or research facility to invent and disseminate new processes and products may be vital to progress, although the product or process be without "utility" as the Court defines the term, because that discovery permits someone else to take a further but perhaps less difficult step leading to a commercially useful item. In my view, our awareness in this age of the importance of achieving and publicizing basic research should lead this Court to resolve uncertainties in its favor and uphold the respondent's position in this case.

# COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS 

1. Why does the majority claim that until an applicant shows an invention is useful, the inventor has not supplied the quid pro quo for a patent? What harm is there in granting a patent on an invention whose utility only becomes clear later? In granting a patent on a useless device? Who would be harmed by the granting of such a patent? Would granting the patent help the inventor attract investment that could help establish utility?
2. Cases following Brenner state that a claimed invention must have a specific and substantial utility that is credible. Asserted uses like "biological activity" or "useful for technical and pharmaceutical purposes" fail the requirement of specific utility; they are too vague. See, e.g., In re Kirk, 376 F.2d 936, 941 (C.C.P.A. 1967). The "substantial" utility standard requires proof that an invention serves some practical purpose, not merely that it is generally promising or promising enough to pursue further. "Simply put, to satisfy the 'substantial' utility requirement, an asserted use must show that that claimed invention has a significant and presently available benefit to the public." Juicy Whip, Inc. v. Orange Bang, Inc., 185 F.3d 1364, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 1999).

The most common application of this requirement comes in chemical and biotechnology cases such as Brenner where a chemical compound is identified and is claimed to have utility as a pharmaceutical product. Although it is difficult to predict accurately how the human body will react to a specific compound, some evidence of basic effectiveness can establish utility. See Ex parte Maas, 9 U.S.P.Q. 2 d 1746 (Bd. Pat. App. \& Int. 1987) (in vitro or animal test data that is reasonably predictive of utility must be accepted if one skilled in the art would find it predictive of utility).

The PTO presumes that claims to utility are credible. In re Langer, 503 F.2d 1380, 1391 (CCPA 1974). The only time the PTO questions utility, therefore, is when an invention presents a "fantastic claim" to utility such as a perpetual motion machine or cold fusion. See Newman v. Quigg, 681 F.Supp. 16 (D.D.C. 1988), aff'd, 877 F. 2 d 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (perpetual motion machine); In re Swartz, 232 F.3d 862 (Fed. Cir. 2000) ("cold fusion"); In re Huping Hu, 848 Fed. Appx. 416 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (upholding rejection of patent application claiming the use of "quantum entanglement"-when fundamental particles such as photons or electrons interact and become linked-to alter gravity, pH values, and temperature at a distance for lack of experimental verification).
3. Utility as a Limitation on Gun Jumping. For the stcroid compounds at issue in Brenner, a practical use was discovered after the patent application was filed-too late to save the patent. So utility might be thought of as a way to control the timing of the patent grant. See Rebecca S. Eisenberg, Analyze This: A Law and Economics Agenda for the Patent System, 53 VAND. L. REV. 2081, 2087 (2000). Why do we require proof of practical utility at the time a patent application is filed? An analogy to land titling provides valuable insight. An early-stage researcher is akin to a "claim jumper" in the law of mining, or to someone who engages in a "land rush," racing to occupy real property simply to stake a claim, without making any real investment. Because these kinds of "racing behaviors" can be wasteful, the law often requires substantial investment before someone is awarded title. This discourages people from making large investments in running from claim to claim-which adds nothing to society's wealth in and of itself-and instead directs investment towards development of the resources in question. See David D. Haddock, First Possession Versus Optimal Timing: Limiting the Dissipation of Economic Value, 64 WASH. U. L.Q. 775 (1986); Terry L. Anderson \& Peter J. Hill, The Race for Property Rights, 33 J.L. \& ECON. 177, 184 (1990); Dean Lueck, The Rule of First Possession and the Design of the Law, 38 J.L. \& ECON. 393 (1995).
4. Use Patents. Justice Harlan's dissent in Brenner highlights an anomaly of patent protection: an inventor who obtains a patent for a product, e.g., a particular molecule, has the right to exclude all others from making, using or selling that product for any and all purposes, including purposes that the inventor did not herself discover or invent. See Robert P. Merges \& Richard Nelson, On the Complex Economics of Patent Scope, 90 COLUM. L. REV. 839, 902-03, 912-14 (1990). For example, a patented compound created for its use as a leather tanning agent might turn out to be an effective treatment for disease. Cf. In re Thuau, 135 F.2d 344 (C.C.P.A. 1943). If so, the patentee would have the right to prevent all others from selling the drug as a treatment-including the person who discovered that the leather tanning compound had therapeutic properties. Note that the utility requirement is met so long as the patentee shows any specific utility for the chemical when the patent is first filed-in our example, when the leather tanning property of the compound is discovered.

The discoverer of the new use can, however, get their own patent on that use. In our example, the discoverer of the disease-fighting property of the leather tanning agent can obtain a process patent for "the process of using [the leather tanning compound] to treat disease." See Rohm \& Haas v. Roberts Chem. Co., 245 F.2d 693 (4th Cir. 1957) (upholding defendant's patent on a new use of a well-known product as a fungicide); 1 DONALD CHISUM, PATENTS §1.03[8] (collecting other cases on this point). This is in essence only an improvement patent; the discoverer would still have to obtain a license from the patentee to use the compound for the treatment of disease. But the reverse is also true; unlike the example outlined above, if the one who discovered the leather tanning agent's therapeutic properties obtained a process patent, the patentee would have to negotiate a license from the improver to have the right to use the compound to treat disease.
5. Utility for pharmaceutical products can generally be established by animal testing. See U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Manual of Patent Examining Procedures §2107.01. In the past, the biotechnology industry sometimes had trouble overcoming utility rejections without clinical data proving that a particular drug was effective in humans, despite Federal Circuit precedent holding that a showing of efficacy in a laboratory experiment was sufficient to establish the utility of a new drug. Cross v. Iizuka, 753 F.2d 1040, 1051 (Fed. Cir. 1985).

The Federal Circuit made it clear that human clinical trials are not necessary to prove the utility of a drug in In re Brana, 51 F.3d 1560 (Fed. Cir. 1995). The court held that the results of in vivo tests in mice were sufficiently probative of efficacy in humans to pass the utility threshold:

The Commissioner, as did the Board, confuses the requirements under the law for obtaining a patent with the requirements for obtaining government approval to market a particular drug for human consumption. . . . FDA approval is not a prerequisite for finding a compound useful within the meaning of the patent laws. . . . Usefulness in patent law, and in particular in the context of pharmaceutical inventions, necessarily includes the expectation of further research and development. . . . Were we to require Phase II testing in order to prove utility, the associated costs would prevent many companies from obtaining patent protection on promising new inventions, thereby eliminating an incentive to pursue, through research and development, potential cures in many crucial areas such as the treatment of cancer.
Brana, 51 F.3d at 1567. On the other hand, in In re Ziegler, 992 F.2d 1197, 1203 (Fed. Cir. 1993), the Federal Circuit held that a patent applicant was not entitled to claim priority to a 1954 application for "polypropylene," since at the time of the 1954 application "at best, Ziegler was on the way to discovering a practical utility for polypropylene . . . but in that application Ziegler had not yet gotten there." Are these two cases distinguishable?
6. Brenner in many ways represents the high-water mark of the utility doctrine. Most applications of the doctrine have been limited in the hurdles they place before inventors. Certainly frivolous ideas are sometimes patented-such as a method of painting using a baby's bottom and a thumb-wrestling ring with stabilizing handlesuggesting that utility is not an effective mechanism for weeding out economically insignificant inventions. See Scan B. Scymore, Making Patents Useful, 98 Minn. L. REV. 1046 (2014) (proposing tightening of the utility requirement).
7. PTO Utility Guidelines. Drawing on Brenner, the PTO promulgated guidelines requiring that an asserted utility be "specific, credible, and substantial." The credibility element was well known; it is the basis of utility rejections for far-fetched inventions such as perpetual motion machines. The novel aspects of the guidelines were (1) the definition of a "specific" utility and (2) the addition of a new requirement of "substantial" utility. See Utility Examination Guidelines, 66 Fed. Reg. 1092 (Jan. 5, 2001).
8. Specific Utility. The PTO training materials based on the guidelines give as an example an asserted utility for a gene sequence, claimed to be useful to identify an unspecified discase. The Patent Office would now consider this not specific enough. More detail-such as the specific type of discase sought to be identified-would be required. As regards "substantial" utility, the guidelines state that the "requirement excludes 'throw-away,' 'insubstantial,' or 'nonspecific' utilities, such as the use of a complex invention as landfill."

The reason that "throwaway" utilities are not acceptable is that they permit patents to issue on inventions whose greatest value has yet to be realized. This is particularly acute in the area of gene sequences. The raw sequence information is of only nominal value in itself. The real value lies in identifying the whole genes that include each sequence, and even more importantly, identifying which traits those genes code for. Only then can proteins be mass produced, diseases identified, and gene therapies devised. These are the very "downstream" uses that Heller and Eisenberg are at pains to protect from patent blockages, i.e., "anticommons." Michael A. Heller \& Rebecca Eisenberg, Can Patents Deter Innovation? The Anticommons in Biomedical Research, 280 SCIENCE 698 (1998).

The Federal Circuit ruled in In re Fisher, 421 F.3d 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2005), that claims to "expressed sequence tags" (ESTs)-fragments of DNA nucleotide sequenceswithout identifying how they are useful do not satisfy the utility requirement. The court rejected the notion that sequence information is sufficiently useful as a research tool-such as a microscope-for better understanding the DNA puzzle. It reasoned that while any given DNA sequence could be used as a marker, none was more useful than any other, so they did not meet the requirement of utility specific to the claimed invention. As we examine in Section III(B)(5)(iii), the Supreme Court ruled that DNA sequences are not patent eligible because they are naturally occurring substances, but complementary DNA (cDNA) molecules or other modified DNA sequences are potentially patent-eligible.

# NOTE ON MORAL UTILITY 

The concept of immoral subject matter originated in dictum from a Joseph Story opinion. Lowell v. Lewis, 15 F. Cas. 1018 (No. 8568) (C.C.D. Mass. 1817). As examples of useless inventions, he cited patents to "poison people, or to promote debauchery, or to facilitate private assassination." This doctrine was often invoked in the late nineteenth century to deny patents on gambling devices. Some courts barred patents on inventions that were useful for things other than gambling if they could be used for gambling. See, e.g., Schultz v. Holtz, 82 F. 448 (N.D. Cal. 1897) (invalidating patent on coin return device for coin-operated machines because it had application to slot machines). Courts struck down patents on this basis well into the twentieth century. See, e.g., Meyer v. Buckley Mfg. Co., 15 F.Supp. 640, 641 (N.D. Ill. 1936) (denying patent on "game of chance" vending machine where user inserted coin and tried to manipulate miniature steam shovel to scoop up a toy). By the 1970s, however, the courts were regularly upholding patents on gambling devices-both because gambling was no longer seen as a major moral issue and because courts had become waricr of denying patents on the basis of an indeterminate moral standard. See, e.g., Ex parte Murphy, 200 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 801, 803 (Bd. Pat. App. \& Int. 1977) (upholding claim for "one-armed bandit").

The fight against immoral inventions was not limited to patents for gambling devices. Another line of cases denied patents for inventions that could be used only to defraud. In Juicy Whip, Inc. v. Orange Bang, Inc., 185 F.3d 1364 (Fed. Cir. 1999), the inventor claimed a juice dispensing system that only appeared to circulate fresh juice. In actuality, it circulated an undrinkable liquid, while the tanks hidden underneath the glass bowl display dispensed the actual juice. The asserted utilities were this arrangement reduced maintenance costs and avoided contamination.
![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)
U.S. Patent No. 5,575,405

The defendant in Juicy Whip, who had infringed the design, took the remarkable position that the technology at issue was immoral in that it defrauded the public. We say remarkable, in that the defendant was, by infringing the technology, also defrauding the public on its theory. The Federal Circuit used the case to remove questions of morality from patent validity analysis. The court observed that " [t] he fact that one product can be altered to make it look like another is in itself a specific benefit sufficient to satisfy the statutory requirement of utility." The court gave the examples of cubic zirconium (designed to simulate a diamond), imitation gold leaf (designed to imitate real gold leaf), synthetic fabrics (designed to simulate expensive natural fabrics), and imitation leather (designed to look like real leather).

In each case, the invention of the product or process that makes such imitation possible has 'utility' within the meaning of the patent statute, and indeed there are numerous patents directed toward making one product imitate another. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,762,968 (method for producing imitation grill marks on food without using heat); U.S. Pat. No. 5,899,038 (laminated flooring imitating wood); U.S. Pat. No. 5,571,545 (imitation hamburger). Much of the value of such products resides in the fact that they appear to be something they are not. Thus, in this case the claimed post-mix dispenser meets the statutory requirement of utility by embodying the features of a post-mix dispenser while imitating the visual appearance of a pre-mix dispenser.

The fact that customers may believe they are receiving fluid directly from the display tank does not deprive the invention of utility. . . . [E]ven if the use of a reservoir containing fluid that is not dispensed is considered deceptive, that is not by itself sufficient to render the invention unpatentable. The requirement of 'utility' in patent law is not a directive to the Patent and Trademark Office or the courts to serve as arbiters of deceptive trade practices. Other agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission and the Food and Drug Administration, are assigned the task of protecting consumers from fraud and deception in the sale of food products. Cf. In re Watson, 517 F.2d 465, 474-76 (CCPA 1975) (stating that it is not the province of the Patent Office to determine, under section 101, whether drugs are safe). As the Supreme Court put the point more generally, "Congress never intended that the patent laws should displace the police powers of the States, meaning by that term those powers by which the health, good order, peace and general welfare of the community are promoted." Webber v. Virginia, 103 U.S. (13 Otto) 344, 347-48 (1880).

Of course, Congress is free to declare particular types of inventions unpatentable for a variety of reasons, including deceptiveness. Cf. 42 U.S.C. §2181(a) (exempting from patent protection inventions useful solely in connection with special nuclear material or atomic weapons). Until such time as Congress does so, however, we find no basis in section 101 to hold that inventions can be ruled unpatentable for lack of utility simply because they have the capacity to fool some members of the public. The district court therefore erred in holding that the invention of the ' 405 patent lacks utility because it deceives the public through imitation in a manner that is designed to increase product sales.

# COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS 

1. Patentable Subject Matter as a New Form of Moral Utility. The AIA expressly excludes patents on specific subject matter categories, namely tax strategies and human organisms. See Pub. L. 112-29, §§14, 33, 125 Stat. 284 (2011). These exclusions reflect moral utility concerns. See Laura A. Keay, Morality's Move Within U.S. Patent Law:
From Moral Utility to Subject Matter, 40 AIPLA Q.J. 409 (2012) (describing a recent reemergence in U.S. patent law of the moral utility doctrine as a result of ethical debates surrounding biotechnologies such as human-animal chimeras and genetic diagnostics); Margo A. Bagley, Patent First, Ask Questions Later: Morality and Biotechnology in Patent Law, 45 WM. \& MARY L. REV. 469 (2003) (arguing for just such a revival of the moral utility doctrine); Thomas A. Magnani, The Patentability of Human-Animal Chimeras, 14 BERKELEY TECH. L.J. 443 (1999).
2. Moral Utility Abroad. Other nations have integrated moral and ethical considerations more directly into their patent systems. See Convention on the Grant of European Patents, Oct. 5, 1973, 13 I.L.M. 268, Art. 53(a) (providing that "European patents shall not be granted in respect of: (a) inventions the publication or exploitation of which would be contrary to ordre public or morality"); Cynthia M. Ho, Splicing Morality and Patent Law: Issues Arising from Mixing Mice and Men, 2 WASH. U. J.L. \& POL'Y 247 (2000) (discussing the controversy surrounding the patenting of the oncogene mouse and the differences between the U.S. and Europe). See also Patent Law of the People's Republic of China, 2008, at Article 5 ("Patent rights shall not be granted for invention-creations that violate the law or social ethics, or harm public interests.").

Should patent examiners serve as moral censors? Do such standards risk subjecting technological advance to special interest politics? See Benjamin D. Enerson, Protecting Society from Patently Offensive Inventions: The Risk of the Moral Utility Doctrine, 89 CORNELL L. REV. 685 (2004).

# PROBLEM III-7 

Worn Look, Inc. (WLI) is a fabric design company that specializes in designing jeans for the high-end fashion market. WLI develops a process for producing a "random shredded effect" on the fabric of new jeans, catering to the market for new jeans that appear to be pre-worn and partially torn. ALI seeks a patent not only on the process of treating the jeans to produce a random shredded effect but on jeans treated by this process. The patent examiner rejects the claim to pre-shredded jeans on the ground that they lack utility. Is this rejection proper? What test of utility does the patent examiner apply here?
