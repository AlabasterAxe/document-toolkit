The concept of novelty, at least as it relates to patent law, seems simple. All we need is a timeline. The first person to invent wins the race. Yet operationalizing this concept into an administrable and effective system of quasi-property rights in intangible resources raises some challenging policy choices. Even defining the moment of invention-what we call "conception"-introduces significant complications. And proving that moment adds evidentiary complexities.

For most of its history, the U.S. has operated under a first-to-invent system. The old law, Section 102 of the 1952 Patent Act, embodies the principle that only truly new inventions deserve patents, and that as between two claimants it is the first to invent who deserves protection. But even this system required some adaptations so as to encourage prompt filing of applications.

Most of the rest of the world, by contrast, has long operated under a first-to-file system, awarding the patent to the first person to bring the invention to the patent office. After decades of diplomacy, the U.S. significantly shifted toward the international standard through the enactment of the America Invents Act (AIA) of 2011. For all patent applications filed on or after March 16, 2013, the U.S. novelty regime is a variation on the international first-to-file system. We say variation because the AIA regime still permits an inventor a one year grace period under certain conditions. As a result, the U.S. regime still diverges from other first-to-file systems, but is much closer to regimes in other nations than it was under the 1952 Act.

Since part of the goal of the AIA was to both harmonize U.S. law with international law and to simplify the complex mechanics of the 1952 Act regime, you might think that your task in learning patent law is far simpler than prior generations of law students. Unfortunately, the opposite is true. Until at least 2033, patent lawyers must understand both the 1952 Act novelty regime (which governs patent applications filed prior to March 16, 2013) and the simpler AIA novelty regime, which governs all patents filed since that date.

The wording of specific prior art categories used in the AIA was carried over from the 1952 Act, and indeed, many phrases originate in even earlier versions of the Patent Act. Many crucial terms in this body of law carry with them extensive case law interpretations. It is generally understood, in patent law as elsewhere, that when Congress chooses to preserve legal language with an extensive body of interpretive case law behind it, that choice means that accepted case law interpretations are carried forward into the new legislative enactment. For purposes of the AIA, this general rule has some important consequences. One is that many older cases dealing with prior art will still be relevant when post-AIA patents begin to dominate patent litigation. Thus, many of the cases and principles we discuss in covering the 1952 regime will be important in understanding the AIA as well.

# i. The 1952 Regime 

Under the 1952 Act, §102 sets forth two subsets of requirements for a patent to issue: (1) the invention is novel (subsections (a), (e), (f), and (g)); and (2) the application was filed in a timely manner, i.e., it is not subject to a "statutory bar" (subsections (b), (c), and (d)).

The first set of requirements, referred to as anticipation or lack of novelty, seeks to ensure that a patent issues only to the first inventor. This goal is accomplished by using the applicant's date of invention as the relevant baseline for analysis. Prior art-such as published articles (including publicly accessible websites), publicly known techniques, and marketed products-containing all elements of the claimed invention will anticipate, and thereby defeat, the patent claim. The same is true of patent applications filed by a third party before an inventor's application, as long as that earlier third party application is eventually published or issued as a patent.

The second set of requirements, known as statutory bars, promote timely filing by requiring that the patentee file an application within one year of various triggering events. In many cases, the bar arises because of something the inventor does. The classic example is publication of a scientific article. If an inventor fails to file a patent application within one year of the article's publication, she is barred from receiving a patent. She suffers a "loss of right."

Section 102 provides that "A person shall be entitled to a patent unless" various conditions set forth in subsections (a) through (g) stand in the way. Before turning to those conditions, which will occupy much of our study, it is worthwhile noting the evidentiary structure of this statutory provision. By stating that "[a] person shall be entitled to a patent unless" (emphasis added), Congress placed the burden of defeating patentability on the PTO. Thus, in rejecting a patent application, the PTO must establish the failure of one of the conditions of patentability.

The principal conditions of 102 are printed below, with bracketed insertions. Note that §102(a) is concerned with novelty, while the statutory bars are set forth in §102(b).

# 1952 Act: 35 U.S.C. §102. Conditions for Patentability; Novelty and Loss of Right to Patent 

A person shall be entitled to a patent unless- (a) [Novelty] the invention was known or used by others in this country, or patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country, before the invention thereof by the applicant for patent, or (b) [Statutory Bars] the invention was patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country or in public use or on sale in this country, more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent in the United States, or (c) [Abandonment] [the inventor] has abandoned the invention, or (d) [Late filing in the U.S.] the invention was first patented or caused to be patented . . . by the applicant . . . in a foreign country prior to the date of the application for patent in this country on an application for patent... filed more than twelve months before the filing of the application in the United States, or (e) [Secret Prior Art: Previously-filed applications] The invention was described in (1) [a published patent application] by another filed in the United States before the invention by the applicant for patent . . . or (2) a patent granted on an application for patent by another filed in the United States before the invention thereof by the applicant for patent . . . or (f) [Derivation] he did not himself invent the subject matter sought to be patented, or (g) [First-to-Invent] (1) [inter partes proceedings] during the course of an interference ..., another inventor involved therein establishes, to the extent permitted in section 104. . that before such person's invention thereof the invention was made by such other inventor and not abandoned, suppressed, or concealed, or (2) [ex parte prosecution/invalidity defense] before such person's invention thereof, the invention was made in this country by another inventor who had not abandoned, suppressed, or concealed it. In determining priority of invention under this subsection, there shall be considered not only the respective dates of conception and reduction to practice of the invention, but also the reasonable diligence of one who was first to conceive and last to reduce to practice, from a time prior to conception by the other.

# ii. The Nature of Novelty 

Turning to the specific conditions that stand in the way of obtaining a patent, subsection a provides that the invention was known or used by others in this country, or patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country, before the invention thereof by the applicant for patent What does it mean to be "known or used by others"?

## Rosaire v. National Lead Co. <br> United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit 218 F.2d 72 (5th Cir. 1955)

## Tuttle, Circuit Judge

In this suit for patent infringement there is presented to us for determination the correctness of the judgment of the trial court, based on findings of fact and conclusions of law, holding that the two patents involved in the litigation were invalid and void and that furthermore there had been no infringement by defendant.

The Rosaire and Horvitz patents relate to methods of prospecting for oil or other hydrocarbons. The inventions are based upon the assumption that gases have emanated from deposits of hydrocarbons which have been trapped in the earth and that these emanations have modified the surrounding rock. The methods claimed involve the steps of taking a number of samples of soil from formations which are not themselves productive of hydrocarbons, either over a horizontal area or vertically down a well bore, treating each sample, as by grinding and heating in a closed vessel, to cause entrained or absorbed hydrocarbons therein to evolve as a gas, quantitatively measuring the amount of hydrocarbon gas so evolved from each sample, and correlating the measurements with the locations from which the samples were taken.
Plaintiff claims that in 1936 he and Horvitz invented this new method of prospecting for oil. In due course the two patents in suit, Nos. 2,192,525 and 2,324,085, were issued thereon. Horvitz assigned his interest to Rosaire.

In view of the fact that the trial court's judgment that the patents were invalid, would of course dispose of [this infringement suit] if correct, we turn our attention to this issue. [Appellee argues] that work carried on by one Teplitz for the Gulf Oil Corporation invalidated both patents by reason of the relevant provisions of the patent laws which state that an invention is not patentable if it "was known or used by others in this country" before the patentee's invention thereof, 35 U.S.C.A. §102(a). Appellee contends that Teplitz and his coworkers knew and extensively used in the field the same alleged inventions before any date asserted by Rosaire and Horvitz.

On this point appellant himself in his brief admits that "Teplitz conceived of the idea of extracting and quantitatively measuring entrained or absorbed gas from the samples of rock, rather than relying upon the free gas in the samples. We do not deny that Teplitz conceived of the methods of the patents in suit." And further appellant makes the following admission: "We admit that the Teplitz-Gulf work was done before Rosaire and Horvitz conceived of the inventions. We will show, however, that Gulf did not apply for patent until 1939, did not publish Teplitz's ideas, and did not otherwise give the public the benefit of the experimental work."

The question as to whether the work of Teplitz was "an unsuccessful experiment," as claimed by appellant, or was a successful trial of the method in question and a reduction of that method to actual practice, as contended by appellee, is, of course, a question of fact. On this point the trial court made the following finding of fact:

I find as a fact that Abraham J. Teplitz and his coworkers with Gulf Oil Corporation and its Research Department during 1935 and early 1936, before any date claimed by Rosaire, spent more than a year in the oil fields and adjacent territory around Palestine, Texas, taking and analyzing samples both over an area and down drill holes, exactly as called for in the claims of the patents which Rosaire and Horvitz subsequently applied for and which are here in suit.

This Teplitz work was a successful and adequate field trial of the prospecting method involved and a reduction to practice of that method. The work was performed in the field under ordinary conditions without any deliberate attempt at concealment or effort to exclude the public and without any instructions of secrecy to the employees performing the work.
As we view it, if the court's findings of fact are correct then under the statute as construed by the courts, we must affirm the finding of the trial court that [appellant's] patents were invalid.
[T]here was sufficient evidence to sustain the finding of the trial court that there was more here than an unsuccessful or incomplete experiment. It is clear that the work was not carried forward, but that appears to be a result of two things: (1) that the geographical area did not lend itself properly to the test, and (2) that the "entire gas prospecting program was therefore suspended in September of 1936, in order that the accumulated information might be thoroughly reviewed." It will be noted that the program was not suspended to test the worth of the method but to examine the data that was produced by use of the method involved.

With respect to the argument advanced by appellant that the lack of publication of Teplitz's work deprived an alleged infringer of the defense of prior use, we find no case which constrains us to hold that where such work was done openly and in the ordinary course of the activities of the employer, a large producing company in the oil industry, the statute is to be so modified by construction as to require some affirmative act to bring the work to the attention of the public at large.

While there is authority for the proposition that one of the basic principles underlying the patent laws is the enrichment of the art, and that a patent is given to encourage disclosure of inventions, no case we have found requires a holding that, under the circumstances that attended the work of Teplitz, the fact of public knowledge must be shown before it can be urged to invalidate a subsequent patent.

# COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS 

1. The Federal Circuit considered a similar fact situation in New Railroad Mfg., L.L.C. v. Vermeer Mfg. Co., 298 F.3d 1290 (Fed. Cir. 2002), a case raising a §102(b) statutory bar asserting that the claimed invention was in "public use" more than one year prior to the application filing date. Patentee New Railroad had tested a drill bit in underground drilling that occurred before the critical date for its patent. In response to the patentee's argument that its use was either nonpublic or experimental, the court followed the reasoning of Rosaire and invalidated the patent. In dissent, Judge Dyk noted that " [t] he use actually took place under public land, hidden from view, and there has been no showing whatsoever that the use was anything but confidential. To understand the method of using the drill bit a person at the job site would have to view the drill bit or see it in operation, and this was impossible to do while the drill bit was underground." Id. at 1300 .
2. In W.L. Gore \& Assocs., Inc. v. Garlock, Inc., 721 F.2d 1540 (Fed. Cir. 1983), the Federal Circuit had this to say about "secret" prior use, where patentee Gore argued that prior use by another of a machine conforming to the elements of Gore's claim was nonpublic and therefore nonanticipatory:

The nonsecret use of a claimed process in the usual course of producing articles for commercial purposes is a public use. Electric Storage Battery Co. v. Shimadzu, 307 U.S. 5, 20 (1939). . . Thus it cannot be said that the district court erred in determining that the invention set forth in claim 1 of the ' 566 patent was known or used by others under §102(a), as evidenced by ... operation of the ' 401 machine before Dr. Gore's asserted date of that invention. By contrast, a use that is affirmatively kept secret is not prior art, and so will not bar a third party from later patenting the invention.
3. The very expansive view taken in Rosaire of what it means for a disclosure to be "public" was criticized by one scholar:
The term "public" . . . seems merely to mean "not secret." It is unnecessary to show that the previous discovery was ever used commercially, that it was in fact observable by the public if such a process or device would not normally be so viewed, or that it was known to more than a few persons. This construction of the term "public" seems questionable, since it may result in the denial of a patent even though the subsequent inventor has conferred a benefit by filing the invention with the public records.
Comment, Prior Art in the Patent Law, 73 HARv. L. Rev. 369, 373 (1959). The author goes on to propose a "higher standard of knowledge or use," arguing that an invention should be considered "known or used" only if it was so widely known or used that an ordinary skilled worker exercising reasonable diligence to learn the state of the art would have discovered, recognized, and been able to construct the invention.
Id. at 373. In effect, this proposal would apply a trade secret standard of novelty to the patent law-an invention could be "new" even though it had been made before, as long as it was not in general knowledge or use. Are there any problems with applying this weaker standard of novelty to determine whether a patent should be issued? Can it be reconciled with the broad language of section 102(a), precluding patents on inventions that were previously "known or used by others in this country"?

In Hall v. MacNeale, 107 U.S. (17 Otto) 90 (1883), Hall had in 1866 received a patent on an improved design for the door and walls of burglar-proof safes. The question before the Court was whether the use of certain earlier-model safes before the critical date was public enough to create a statutory bar. The Court held:

The construction and arrangement and purpose and mode of operation and use of the [hidden feature] in the safes were necessarily known to the workmen who put them in. They were, it is true, hidden from view, after the safes were completed, and it required a destruction of the safe to bring them into view. But this was no concealment of them or use of them in secret. They had no more concealment than was inseparable from any legitimate use of them.
In other words, the public use of a device starts the one-year clock running on that device even if the patented invention isn't evident on the face of the device.
4. One issue in Rosaire was the patentce's allegation that the Teplitz work was not prior art because it was incomplete, a mere "abandoned experiment." On this issue, consider Picard v. United Aircraft Corp., 128 F.2d 632 (2d Cir. 1942) (L. Hand, J.):

It is true that another's experiment, imperfect and never perfected, will not serve either as an anticipation or as part of the prior art, for it has not served to enrich it. The patented invention does not become "known" by such a use or sale, or by anything of which the art cannot take hold and make use as it stands. But the mere fact that an earlier "machine" or "manufacture," sold or used, was an experiment does not prevent its becoming an anticipation or a part of the prior art, provided it was perfected and thereafter became publicly known. Whether it does become so depends upon how far it becomes a part of the stock of knowledge of the art in question. Judged by that standard, the Curtiss engine [prior art reference] was not an "abandoned experiment"; it had been perfected; it had withstood a severer test than was necessary in use; it had been sold; it remained permanently accessible to the art, a contribution to the sum of knowledge so far as it went.
5. Prior Art Enablement. In order to anticipate a patent claim, a prior art reference must be enabling. "Enablement of prior art requires that the reference teach a skilled artisan-at the time of filing-to make or carry out what it discloses in relation to the claimed invention without undue experimentation." In re Morsa, 803 F.3d 1374, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2015). The §102 enablement inquiry diverges, however, from the §112 invalidation standard, which we explore in III(B)(4)(i). As the Federal Circuit emphasized in Agilent Technologies, Inc. v. Synthego Corp., -F.4th - 2025 WL 1645693 (Fed. Cir. 2025), "for a prior-art reference to be enabling, it need not enable the [challenged] claim in its entirety, but instead the reference need only enable a single embodiment of the claim."
6. Proof of Prior Use. In Woodland Trust v. Flowertree Nursery, Inc., 148 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1998), defendant Flowertree challenged the invalidity of the patent owned by Woodland based on prior use of a nursery watering system identical to that claimed in the patent:

Under §102(a), Flowertree stated that the method was previously known and used by each of Joseph Burke and William Hawkins (an owner of Flowertree) in the 1960s and 1970s at their nurseries in Florida, and was then discontinued by these users in 1976 and 1978. The district court found that Hawkins' system at Flowertree was reconstructed in 1988.

Four witnesses testified in support of the defense of prior knowledge and use . . . Mark Hawkins is the son of William Hawkins; he testified that his father's system, on which he worked as a child, was destroyed by a tornado in 1978, and was not reconstructed until 1988. Joseph Burke is a nursery owner who has known William Hawkins since the 1960s; he testified that he used the same system as shown in the patent, but tore it down in 1976 and did not rebuild it. Charles Hudson is a nursery owner who had worked for Joseph Burke, and John Kaufmann is a life-long friend of William Hawkins; they testified that they observed the patented system at the Burke or Hawkins nursery, before its use was discontinued.
148 F.3d at 1369. The Federal Circuit reviewed Supreme Court precedent laying down a stringent corroboration requirement, and then concluded:

This guidance, applied to this case, reinforces the heavy burden when establishing prior public knowledge and use based on long-past events. The Supreme Court's view of human nature as well as human recollection, whether deemed cynical or realistic, retains its cogency. This view is reinforced, in modern times, by the ubiquitous paper trail of virtually all commercial activity. It is rare indeed that some physical record (e.g., a written document such as notes, letters, invoices, notebooks, or a sketch or drawing or photograph showing the device, a model, or some other contemporancous record) does not exist.

In this case, despite the asserted many years of commercial and public use, we take note of the absence of any physical record to support the oral evidence. The asserted prior knowledge and use by Hawkins and Burke was said to have begun approximately thirty years ago and to have continued for about a decade. Hawkins testified that his prior use was terminated in 1978, and the district court found that Hawkins' system was not reconstructed until 1988. The relationship of the witnesses and the fact that the asserted prior uses ended twenty years before the trial, and were abandoned until the defendant reportedly learned of the patentee's practices, underscore the failure of this oral evidence to provide clear and convincing evidence of prior knowledge and use. The district court did not rely on the two undated photographs, and indeed their lack of detail and clarity can not have provided documentary support.

With the guidance of precedent, whose cautions stressed the frailty of memory of things long past and the temptation to remember facts favorable to the cause of one's relative or friend, we conclude that this oral evidence, standing alone, did not provide the clear and convincing evidence necessary to invalidate a patent on the ground of prior knowledge and use under §102(a). Id. at 1373 .

Do you agree with the Federal Circuit's implication that in the absence of a strong corroboration requirement for prior public use evidence, there would be a temptation for competitors of a patentee to lie? Is it likely that the witnesses in Woodland Trust really made the whole thing up? Note that the alleged prior use was the defendant's own use, so in that particular case the defendant might have had an incentive to lie. With such a strong requirement of documentary evidence, is there much difference between public use evidence and proof that an invention appeared in a prior publication or patent?
7. Inherency - Section 102(a) provides that an applicant is not entitled to a patent if her invention was "known or used by others" prior to the date of the applicant's invention. The meaning of this phrase has been called into question in a series of cases involving unintended, "accidental" anticipation of an invention. Most of these cases involve the inherent, unintended production of a particular physical product. When an inventor later intentionally makes the product, presumably because she has some use for it, the prior unintended production of the product may be raised as prior art to the invention.

On the one hand, a venerable line of cases holds that where the first, accidental producer was not aware of the product and did not attempt to produce it, the first production did not bar a patent on the "invention" of the product. Thus, in Tilghman v. Proctor, 102 U.S. 707 (1880), the Supreme Court held that the accidental separation of fat acids from tallow during operation of a steam engine lubricated by tallow did not anticipate Tilghman's patent for a similar separation process. Of the prior production, the Court said:

They revealed no process for the manufacture of fat acids. If the acids were accidentally and unwittingly produced, whilst the operators were in pursuit of other and different results, without exciting attention and without it even being known what was done or how it had been done, it would be absurd to say that this was an anticipation of Tilghman's discovery.
Id. at 711 . On the other hand, an equally venerable line of cases holds that if a product is known in the art already, an inventor cannot obtain a patent on the product merely by putting it to a new use, "even if the new result had not before been contemplated." Ansonia Brass \& Copper Co. v. Elec. Supply Co., 144 U.S. 11 (1892). The inventor could obtain a patent on the new process using that product, however. For more on this distinction, see Atlas Powder Co. v. Ireco, Inc., 190 F.3d 1342 (Fed. Cir. 1999).

Newer Federal Circuit cases have focused on whether an invention was present in the prior art in a way that provided a public benefit. The knowledge of those in the art has been de-emphasized as a factor. In Schering Corp. v. Geneva Pharms., Inc., 339 F.3d 1373, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2003), the court invalidated a claim to a compound that is necessarily produced in the human body whenever a person ingests the allergy medicine Claritin-even though the patentee Schering-Plough argued that no one knew about the claimed product until Schering characterized it. See also Abbott Labs v. Geneva Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 182 F.3d 1315 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (distinguishing Tilghman in case where prior art product was appreciated and sold, even though party did not appreciate qualities of product). Another case is Prima Tek II, L.L.C. v. Polypap, S.A.R.L., 412 F.3d 1284 (Fed. Cir. 2005), where the court invalidated a claim to a "potless" floral arrangement holder (see diagram). The claim included, among other things, the elements of (1) a band to hold the floral arrangement; (2) a sheet of decorative material covering the floral arrangement; and (3) "means for forming a crimped portion in the sheet of material." 412 F.3d 1284, 1287 n.1. Polypap, the accused infringer, argued that a published French patent application, the "Charrin reference," inherently anticipated the claim. The patentee Prima Tek countered with the argument that Charrin did not disclose the "crimping" limitation. The court agreed with Polypap, noting that in the drawing below Charrin clearly discloses a string along the top of the floral arrangement holder which necessarily creates crimping in the covering material:
![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
In other words, the invention was already present in the prior art, because the decorative material would be crimped whenever the Charrin device was used, whether or not people recognized or intended that result. See Dan L. Burk \& Mark A. Lemley, Inherency, 47 Wm. \& MARY L. REV. 371 (2005) (endorsing the move to public benefit, and making the point that if skilled artisans know about the prior use, then there is no need for an inherency doctrine at all).
8. Artificial Intelligence and Prior Art Searching. With advances in artificial intelligence and the ingestion of vast amounts of knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs), inventors, patent examiners, and competitors now have vastly expanded access to prior art. This expansion includes non-patent literature (NPL) such as technical papers and journals, which is often overlooked in traditional searches. These advances reduce search costs and promise to improve patent quality. But they may also make it harder to obtain a patent, since the person of skill in the art now has access to all the world's knowledge.

# iii. Statutory Bars 

Section 102(b) bars the granting of a patent where the invention was patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country or in public use or on sale in this country, more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent in the United States.
Recall from the introduction to this section that one difference between statutory bars and novelty is that an inventor can create a statutory bar by her own actions (e.g., publication of an article), whereas she cannot destroy the novelty of her own inventions. In short, an inventor's own work cannot be cited against her (in general) under §102(a), but it is "fair game" under §102 (b). Note, however, that the 1952 Act affords the inventor a one-year grace period for filing a patent application following one of the statutory bar triggers-patenting, printed publication, public, or public use in the U.S.

Notwithstanding this difference between novelty and statutory bars, subsections 102(a) and (b) are not appreciably different for many purposes. For example, courts interpret "publication"-a term common to both subsections-the same in both contexts. Thus, although the following case involves a §102 (b) reference, the reasoning is equally applicable to §102(a).

## In re Hall <br> United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit 781 F.2d 897 (Fed. Cir. 1986)

## BALDWIN, CIRCUIT JUDGE.

This is an appeal from the decision of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's (PTO) former Board of Appeals, adhered to on reconsideration by the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences (board), sustaining the final rejection of claims 1-25 of [Hall's] reissue [a]pplication, based principally on a "printed publication" bar under 35 U.S.C. §102(b). The reference is a doctoral thesis. Because appellant concedes that his claims are unpatentable if the thesis is available as a "printed publication" more than one year prior to the application's effective filing date of February 27, 1979, the only issue is whether the thesis is available as such a printed publication. On the record before us, we affirm the board's decision.

A protest was filed during prosecution of appellant's reissue application which included in an appendix a copy of the dissertation " 1,4--Glucanglukohydrolase ein amylotylisches Enzym ..." by Peter Foldi (Foldi thesis or dissertation). The record indicates that in September 1977, Foldi submitted his dissertation to the Department of Chemistry and Pharmacy at Freiburg University in the Federal Republic of Germany, and that Foldi was awarded a doctorate degree on November 2, 1977. . . .

The examiner made a final rejection of the application claims. He said: "On the basis of the instant record it is reasonable to assume that the Foldi thesis was available (accessible) prior to February 27, 197[8]."

By letter, the PTO's Scientific Library asked Dr. Will whether the Foldi dissertation was made available to the public by being cataloged and placed in the main collection. Dr. Will replied in an October 20, 1983 letter, as translated: "Our dissertations, thus also the Foldi dissertation, are indexed in a special dissertations catalogue, which is part of the general users' catalogue. In the stacks they are likewise set apart in a special dissertation section, which is part of the general stacks."

In response to a further inquiry by the PTO's Scientific Library requesting (1) the exact date of indexing and cataloging of the Foldi dissertation or (2) "the time such procedures normally take," Dr. Will replied in a June 18, 1984 letter: "The Library copies of the Foldi dissertation were sent to us by the faculty on November 4, 1977. Accordingly, the dissertation most probably was available for general use toward the beginning of the month of December, 1977."

The board held that the unrebutted evidence of record was sufficient to conclude that the Foldi dissertation had an effective date as prior art more than one year prior to the filing date of the appellant's initial application.

On appeal, appellant raises two arguments: (1) the §102 (b) "printed publication" bar requires that the publication be accessible to the interested public, but there is no evidence that the dissertation was properly indexed in the library catalog prior to the critical date; and (2) even if the Foldi thesis were cataloged prior to the critical date, the presence of a single cataloged thesis in one university library does not constitute sufficient accessibility of the publication's teachings to those interested in the art exercising reasonable diligence.

The [printed publication] bar is grounded on the principle that once an invention is in the public domain, it is no longer patentable by anyone.

The statutory phrase "printed publication" has been interpreted to give effect to ongoing advances in the technologies of data storage, retrieval, and dissemination. Because there are many ways in which a reference may be disseminated to the interested public, "public accessibility" has been called the touchstone in determining whether a reference constitutes a "printed publication" bar under 35 U.S.C. §§102 (b). The §§102
publication bar is a legal determination based on underlying fact issues, and therefore must be approached on a case-by-case basis. The proponent of the publication bar must show that prior to the critical date the reference was sufficiently accessible, at least to the public interested in the art, so that such a one by examining the reference could make the claimed invention without further research or experimentation.
[A]ppellant argues that the Foldi thesis was not shown to be accessible because Dr. Will's affidavits do not say when the thesis was indexed in the library catalog and do not chronicle the procedures for receiving and processing a thesis in the library.
[A]ppellant would have it that accessibility can only be shown by evidence establishing a specific date of cataloging and shelving before the critical date. While such evidence would be desirable, in lending greater certainty to the accessibility determination, the realities of routine business practice counsel against requiring such evidence. The probative value of routine business practice to show the performance of a specific act has long been recognized. See, e.g., 1 WIGMORE, EVIDENCE §92 (1940); rule 406, FED. R. EVID. Therefore, we conclude that competent evidence of the general library practice may be relied upon to establish an approximate time when a thesis became accessible.

We agree with the board that the evidence of record consisting of Dr. Will's affidavits establishes a prima facie case for unpatentability of the claims under the §102 (b) publication bar. It is a case which stands unrebutted.

Accordingly, the board's decision sustaining the rejection of appellant's claims is affirmed.

# COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS 

1. Note that the issue in this case could arise under either §102 (a) or §102 (b). If the publication had occurred before the invention of the subject matter by the applicant, §102 (a) would apply. Section 102(b) applied in this case because the publication occurred more than one year before the applicant filed for a patent.
2. Compare the "publicness" standard in Hall to the rule in trade secret law (information must be "generally known or readily ascertainable" in an industry). Why is it so much easier to lose patent rights than trade secrets?
3. Poster Sessions. In general, a publication becomes public when it becomes available to at least one member of "the general public." In In re Klopfenstein, 380 F.3d 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2004), the Federal Circuit addressed whether temporary display of scientific research information at a conference "poster session" constituted publication under §102 (b). The court held that the determination of whether the display constitutes a publication turns on a balancing of factors, including: (1) the length of time the display was exhibited; (2) the expertise of the target audience; (3) the existence (or lack thereof) of reasonable expectations that the material displayed would not be copied; and (4) the simplicity or case with which the material displayed could have been copied. The audience, however, need not always be technically sophisticated. In GoPro, Inc. v. Contour IP Holding, LLC, 908 F.3d 690 (Fed. Cir. 2018), the Federal Circuit held that a sales catalog distributed at a trade show targeting marketers rather than engineers qualified as a printed publication because it was available to those interested in the art even if people skilled in the art were not at the trade show.
4. A magazine or technical journal is effective as of its date of publication, i.e., when someone first receives it, rather than the date a manuscript was sent to the publisher or the date the journal or magazine was mailed. See In re Schlittler, 234 F.2d 882 (C.C.P.A. 1956).
5. Websites. Is everything on the internet prior art? Does In re Hall provide any guidance? The Federal Circuit has held that an article posted on the Internet but not indexed in search engines can still be a printed publication, but not information in private, password-protected computer systems. Voter Verified, Inc. v. Premier Election Solutions, Inc., 698 F.3d 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2012).
6. Peer Review of Grant Proposals. Is a grant proposal sent to a limited number of expert reviewers a publication under §102(a)? See E. I. du Pont de Nemours \& Co. v. Cetus Corp., 19 U.S.P.Q.2d (BNA) 1174 (N.D. Cal. 1990) (no).

# PROBLEM III-1 

In late 1967 the Navy encountered a problem with its new fighter plane. The Navy's aircraft-stationed on aircraft carriers-were more likely to suffer structural damage than Air Force planes of the same type that were positioned on land. Navy-scientists concluded that the widespread problem of fuselage cracking, known as "stress corrosion," was attributable to the harsh marine environment. The Navy presented its problem to the aluminum industry, and Algol Corp. was awarded a research contract to develop a new alloy that would be more resistant to the phenomenon.

Pursuant to the terms of the defense contract, Algol would periodically report on its research results in "progress letters." The Navy drew up a distribution list of 33 designees to receive Algol's progress letters, and each letter bore the following "export control" notice: "This Document Is Subject to Special Export Controls and Each Transmittal to Foreign Governments or Foreign Nationals May Be Made Only with Prior Approval of the Naval Air Systems Command."

The designees included aluminum producers (including Algol's competitors), aircraft manufacturers, government agencies, branches of the military, and academic researchers. Several progress letters were mailed, the last on April 5, 1969. As of the last progress letter, Algol had succeeded in developing a high-strength, stress-corrosionresistant alloy that met the Navy's needs. Algol successfully applied for a patent covering its process for aging and treating its new alloy on February 5, 1971.

When Algol refused to license the patent to its competitor Richards, the latter began to manufacture and sell a high-strength alloy using Algol's patented technology. Algol filed suit alleging infringement.

You are Senior Counsel for Intellectual Property Matters at Richards Aluminum. Your defense strategy is limited by the fact that if the Algol patent is valid, your company is undeniably engaged in infringement. Algol gathers evidence that the 33 designees who received Algol's progress reports treated them as highly confidential although they contained no express limitation on access other than the export control notice. Depositions of Richards' own executives reveal that your company kept its copies of the letters in a protected area, screened even from some of its own employees. Such procedures were typical in defense industry circles when a report bearing an export control notice was received. Nevertheless, the absence of any other access restrictions on the letters supports Richards' argument that Richards could have shared the report's contents with every American citizen.

Is the patent anticipated by Algol's prior "publication"? If so, under §102(a) or under §102(b) ?
iv. Statutory Bars: Public Use and On Sale Egbert v. Lippmann Supreme Court of the United States 104 U.S. 333 (1881)
Mr. JUSTICE WOODS delivered the opinion of the court.
This suit was brought for an alleged infringement of the complainant's reissued letters-patent, No. 5216, dated Jan. 7, 1873, for an improvement in corset-springs.

The original letters were issued to Samuel H. Barnes. The reissue was made to the complainant, under her then name, Frances Lee Barnes, executrix of the original patentee.

The specification for the reissue declares:- This invention consists in forming the springs of corsets of two or more metallic plates, placed one upon another, and so connected as to prevent them from sliding off each other laterally or edgewise, and at the same time admit of their playing or sliding upon each other, in the direction of their length or longitudinally, whereby their flexibility and elasticity are greatly increased, while at the same time much strength is obtained.
The bill alleges that Barnes was the original and first inventor of the improvement covered by the reissued letters-patent, and that it had not, at the time of his application for the original letters, been for more than two years in public use or on sale, with his consent or allowance.

The answer takes issue on this averment and also denies infringement. On a final hearing the court dismissed the bill, and the complainant appealed.

We have to consider whether the defence that the patented invention had, with the consent of the inventor, been publicly used for more than two years prior to his application for the original letters, is sustained by the testimony in the record.
[The patent statute] render[s] letters-patent invalid if the invention which they cover was in public use, with the consent and allowance of the inventor, for more than two years prior to his application. ^[3] Since the passage of the act of 1839 it has been strenuously contended that the public use of an invention for more than two years before such application, even without his consent and allowance, renders the letters-patent therefor void.

It is unnecessary in this case to decide this question, for the alleged use of the invention covered by the letters-patent to Barnes is conceded to have been with his express consent.

The evidence on which the defendants rely to establish a prior public use of the invention consists mainly of the testimony of the complainant.

She testifies that Barnes invented the improvement covered by his patent between January and May, 1855; that between the dates named the witness and her friend Miss Cugier were complaining of the breaking of their corset-steels. Barnes, who was present, and was an intimate friend of the witness, said he thought he could make her a pair that would not break. At their next interview he presented her with a pair of corset-steels which he himself had made. The witness wore these steels a long time. In 1858 Barnes made and presented to her another pair, which she also wore a long time. When the corsets in which these steels were used wore out, the witness ripped them open and took out the steels and put them in new corsets. This was done several times.

It is admitted, and, in fact, is asserted, by complainant, that these steels embodied the invention afterwards patented by Barnes and covered by the reissued letters-patent on which this suit is brought.

Joseph H. Sturgis, another witness for complainant, testifies that in 1863 Barnes spoke to him about two inventions made by himself, one of which was a corset-steel, and that he went to the house of Barnes to see them. Before this time, and after the transactions testified to by the complainant, Barnes and [the complainant] had intermarried. Barnes said his wife had a pair of steels made according to his invention in the corsets which she was then wearing, and if she would take them off he would show them to [Sturgis]. Mrs. Barnes went out, and returned with a pair of corsets and a pair of scissors, and ripped the corsets open and took out the steels. Barnes then explained to the witness how they were made and used.

The question for our decision is, whether this testimony shows a public use within the meaning of the statute.

We observe, in the first place, that to constitute the public use of an invention it is not necessary that more than one of the patented articles should be publicly used. The use of a great number may tend to strengthen the proof, but one well-defined case of such use is just as effectual to annul the patent as many. For instance, if the inventor of a mower, a printing press, or a railway-car makes and sells only one of the articles invented by him, and allows the vendee to use it for two years, without restriction or limitation, the use is just as public as if he had sold and allowed the use of a great number.

We remark, secondly, that, whether the use of an invention is public or private does not necessarily depend upon the number of persons to whom its use is known. If an inventor, having made his device, gives or sells it to another, to be used by the donee or vendee, without limitation or restriction, or injunction of secrecy, and it is so used, such use is public, even though the use and knowledge of the use may be confined to one person.

We say, thirdly, that some inventions are by their very character only capable of being used where they cannot be seen or observed by the public eye. An invention may consist of a lever or spring, hidden in the running gear of a watch, or of a rachet, shaft, or cog-wheel covered from view in the recesses of a machine for spinning or weaving. Nevertheless, if its inventor sells a machine of which his invention forms a part, and allows it to be used without restriction of any kind, the use is a public one. So, on the other hand, a use necessarily open to public view, if made in good faith solely to test the qualities of the invention, and for the purpose of experiment, is not a public use within the meaning of the statute.

Tested by these principles, we think the evidence of the complainant herself shows that for more than two years before the application for the original letters there was, by the consent and allowance of Barnes, a public use of the invention, covered by them. He made and gave to her two pairs of corset-steels, constructed according to his device, one in 1855 and one in 1858. They were presented to her for use. He imposed no obligation of secrecy, nor any condition or restriction whatever. They were not presented for the purpose of experiment, nor to test their qualities. No such claim is set up in her testimony. The invention was at the time complete, and there is no evidence that it was afterwards changed or improved. The donee of the steels used them for years for the purpose and in the manner designed by the inventor. They were not capable of any other use. She might have exhibited them to any person, or made other steels of the same kind, and used or sold them without violating any condition or restriction imposed on her by the inventor.

According to the testimony of the complainant, the invention was completed and put to use in 1855. The inventor slept on his rights for eleven years. Letters-patent were not applicd for till March, 1866. In the mean time, the invention had found its way into general, and almost universal, use. A great part of the record is taken up with the testimony of the manufacturers and venders [sic] of corset-steels, showing that before he applied for letters-patent the principle of his device was almost universally used in the manufacture of corset-steels. It is fair to presume that having learned from this general use that there was some value in his invention, he attempted to resume, by his application, what by his acts he had clearly dedicated to the public.

We are of opinion that the defence of two years' public use, by the consent and allowance of the inventor, before he made application for letters-patent, is satisfactorily established by the evidence.

Decree affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE MILLER dissenting.
A private use with consent, which could lead to no copy or reproduction of the machine, which taught the nature of the invention to no one but the party to whom such consent was given, which left the public at large as ignorant of this as it was before the author's discovery, was no abandonment to the public, and did not defeat his claim for a patent. If the little steel spring inserted in a single pair of corsets, and used by only one woman, covered by her outer-clothing, and in a position always withheld from public observation, is a public use of that piece of steel, I am at a loss to know the line between a private and a public use.

# COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS 

1. In what sense was Frances Lee (later Barnes) using the corset steels (i.e., the springs) "publicly"? Why doesn't it matter how many people use the invention, for purposes of deciding if the use was public? Compare this holding to that of the court in Rosaire above.
2. The Court emphasizes that Ms. Barnes never entered into a confidentiality agreement with the inventor. But the Court also relates that the two later married. Does Barnes have a reasonable argument that although no express "injunction of secrecy" was made, nonetheless an implied requirement of secrecy could be inferred from the surrounding circumstances: i.e., an invention of an intimate nature, by a boyfriend (later husband), disclosed to few people? Justice Miller, in dissent, added: "It may well be imagined that a prohibition to the party so permitted [to use the springs] against her use of the steel spring to public observation, would have been supposed to be a piece of irony." 104 U.S. (14 Otto), at 339. Perhaps the embarrassment of asking was enough to keep Mr. Barnes from requesting that Frances Lee not show the invention to anyone. See Kara W. Swanson, Getting a Grip on the Corset: Gender, Sexuality, and Patent Law, 23 Yale J.L. \& Feminism (2011) (analyzing the invention and its social context).
3. Subsequent cases have not abandoned Egbert, but they have perhaps not read it as broadly as they could have. In particular, the Federal Circuit has focused on the nature and purpose of the use in deciding whether it was "public" or not. Use for a commercial purpose is generally a public use, even if it is secret and even if it only occurs once. Confidential, non-commercial uses do not implicate the 'extension of monopoly' rationale for a broad public use category of prior art. So they might not fall within the prior art.

A similar rule has developed with respect to the "on sale" prong of the §102 (b) statutory bar. A single sale or offer to sell a product will start the clock running, whether or not it was made in secret. On the other hand, discussions that do not rise to the level of a definite offer to sell the invention will not bar a later patent on that invention.
4. The policy behind the statutory bars in §102 (b) is to encourage inventors to file patent applications early. The inventor in Egbert did not do so. Was it reasonable to bar him from receiving a patent on his invention for this reason? Is anyone entitled to a patent on this invention?
5. Inventor versus Third Party Use: While "public use" and "on sale" bars frequently result from the inventor's own conduct, they do not have to. Indeed, sales of the invention by a third party can preclude the inventor from later obtaining a patent, even though the third party had stolen the invention from the inventor. Evans Cooling Sys., Inc. v. General Motors, 125 F.3d 1448 (Fed. Cir. 1997). The case arose out of inventor John Evans' demonstration of his aqueous reverse flow cooling system to GM engineers in the spring of 1989. GM, as early as June 13, 1991, received a binding order for sale of a Corvette model car incorporating the aqueous reverse flow cooling system. The district court agreed with GM that this sale created a statutory bar for Evans' subsequent patent application filed July 1, 1992. Evans appealed on two grounds: that no enforceable contract could have been formed in June of 1991 because GM had yet to clear certain requisite regulatory hurdles routinely required for sale of a new car model and that the theft of a trade secret ought to be considered an exception to the general statutory bar rule. The court disposed of the first ground by stating simply that "the mere fact that the offer for sale was illegal or ineffective does not remove it from the purview of the section 102(b) bar." Id. at 1452.

The court found the second ground—the "theft exception"—equally unpersuasive in light of existing case law. It wrote:

While such a result may not seem fair, Evans is not without recourse if GM in fact misappropriated his invention. Evans would have an appropriate remedy in state court for misappropriation of a trade secret. We note as well that the facts Evans alleges in support of its misappropriation claim demonstrate that Evans knew GM stole the invention at the very time it was allegedly stolen because during the demonstration GM employees allegedly told Mr. Evans they intended to steal the invention and a sealed room was unsealed during the night between the tests. Evans' patent rights would have nevertheless been protected if Mr. Evans had filed a patent application no more than one year from the date of the demonstration. This he did not do; instead Mr. Evans waited for more than two years after the demonstration and some six years after it was reduced to practice.

Id. at 1453-54. For a case involving both a close question of "public accessibility/confidentiality" as well as theft-of-idea issues as in Evans Cooling, see Delano Farms Co. v. California Table Grape Comm'n, 778 F.3d 1243, 1249 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (grape variety, stolen from plant patentee, was planted and subsequently transferred to another under conditions of secrecy; the grape vines were not visible to the public and were generally handled in "an environment of confidentiality"; held, not a public use that bars the patent). Other major patent systems exclude stolen information from being included in the prior art (or "state of the art") under the principle of "evident abuse of the [rightful] applicant." See Robert P. Merges and Seagull Haiyan Song, Transnational Intellectual Property Law 95, 106 (2018) (discussing China and Europe).

6. On-Sale Bar—Commercial Sale and Ready for Patenting. Must an invention actually be completed and built before it can be sold or "offered for sale"? The Supreme Court has said no. Pfaff v. Wells Elec., Inc., 525 U.S. 55 (1998). The Court reasoned that "invention" occurred when the inventor conceived of the product and did not require proof that the invention has actually been built. Indeed, it noted, many famous inventions (including Alexander Graham Bell's telephone) were patented before a prototype was ever built. Id. at 308-09. However, the Court did require evidence that the inventive concept itself was "complete, rather than merely ... substantially complete":
[T]he on-sale bar applies when two conditions are satisfied before the critical date. First, the product must be the subject of a commercial offer for sale. . . .

Second, the invention must be ready for patenting. That condition may be satisfied in at least two ways: by proof of reduction to practice before the critical date; or by proof that prior to the critical date the inventor had prepared drawings or other descriptions of the invention that were sufficiently specific to enable a person skilled in the art to practice the invention. In this case the second condition of the on-sale bar is satisfied because the drawings Pfaff sent to the manufacturer before the critical date fully disclosed the invention.
Id. at 67. See also Weatherchem Corp. v. J.L. Clark, Inc., 163 F.3d 1326 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (applying Pfaff to case where detailed drawings had been made in preparation of an offer for sale). Contrast Pfaff with Micro Chem., Inc. v. Great Plains Chem. Co., 103 F.3d 1538 (Fed. Cir. 1997) ("Because Pratt was not close to completion of the invention at the time of the alleged offer and had not demonstrated a high likelihood that the invention would work for its intended purpose upon completion, his December 1984 'offer' could not trigger the on-sale bar.").
7. Commercial Sale of the Claimed Invention. Several cases address the relationship between contract law and the "on sale" bar. In Group One, Ltd. v. Hallmark Cards, Inc., 254 F.3d 1041, 1047 (Fed. Cir. 2001), the patentee and a third party had corresponded and engaged in other interactions in connection with a later-patented technology. The Federal Circuit refused to find that this exploratory discussion placed the invention "on sale" under §102(b). Only a transaction which "rises to the level of a commercial offer for sale" under the Uniform Commercial Code triggers the on-sale bar. Where an inventor licenses rights to a process invention, e.g., to a licensee who will help develop the patented technology, this is not a sale of patented embodiments, so the on-sale bar does not apply. See In re Kollar, 286 F.3d 1326, 1330-32 (Fed. Cir. 2002) ("[a]lthough the Celanese Agreement specifically contemplates that 'resultant products' manufactured using the claimed process could potentially be sold, nowhere in the Celanese Agreement is there an indication that a product of the claimed process was actually offered for sale. Rather, that agreement constitutes a license to Celanese under any future patents relating to Kollar's invention." (emphasis in original; footnote omitted)). Confidential sales or offers place an invention "on sale" for purposes of §102(b). See, e.g., Builder Inc. v. Kason Indus., Inc., 849 F.2d 1461, 1464 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (firm offer sent to prospective purchaser was an "on sale" event, even though the offer was marked "confidential"); Pfaff v. Wells Elecs., Inc., 525 U.S. 55 (1998) (nowhere mentioning the need for information about a sale to be publicly available).
7. Public Use-Informing versus Non-Informing (or Secret) Use/Patentee versus Third-Party Activity. Although the 1952 Act makes no distinction based on whether a public use of a patented process reveals the patented invention, the courts have distinguished between patentee and third-party secret commercial uses. A patentee's secret commercial use is treated as a public use and therefore will bare them from later getting a patent, whereas a third party's is not. Compare Metallizing Engineering Co. v. Kenyon Bearing \& Auto Parts Co., 153 F.2d 516 (2d Cir.1946) (Hand, J.) (patentee's own secret use of machine to produce products for sale is an public use barring a patent on the machine after a year) with W.L. Gore \& Associates, Inc. v. Garlock, Inc., 721 F. 2 d 1540 (1983) (third party secret sale of tape from tape-making machine did not bar a patent on the machine to an inventor who filed more than one year after that third party sale); see generally Woodland Trust v. Flowertree Nursery, 148 F.3d 1368, 1370-71 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (observing that "[s]ection 102(b), unlike §102(a), is primarily concerned with the policy that encourages an inventor to enter the patent system promptly"). This distinction is based on the policy concern that without such a limit, an inventor could keep his invention secret for years or even decades while profiting from its use, then file a patent application. Because that application was filed later, the patent would expire later, extending the effective life of the inventor's protection. This distinction lacks a textual basis, although it is well-established in Federal Circuit jurisprudence.

# v. Statutory Bars: The Experimental Use Exception 

## City of Elizabeth v. Pavement Company Supreme Court of the United States 97 U.S. 126 (1877)

MR. JUSTICE BRADLEY delivered the opinion of the court.
This suit was brought by the American Nicholson Pavement Company against the city of Elizabeth, N.J., upon a patent issued to Samuel Nicholson, dated Aug. 20, 1867, for a new and improved wooden pavement, being a second reissue of a patent issued to said Nicholson Aug. 8, 1854. The reissued patent was extended in 1868 for a further term of seven years. . . [I]n the specification, it is declared that the nature and object of the invention consists in providing a process or mode of constructing wooden block pavements upon a foundation along a street or roadway with facility, cheapness, and accuracy, and also in the creation and construction of such a wooden pavement as shall be comparatively permanent and durable, by so uniting and combining all its parts, both superstructure and foundation, as to provide against the slipping of the horses' feet, against noise, against unequal wear, and against rot and consequent sinking away from below.

The bill charges that the defendants infringed this patent by laying down wooden pavements in the city of Elizabeth, N.J., constructed in substantial conformity with the process patented, and prays an account of profits, and an injunction.

The defendants . . . averred that the alleged invention of Nicholson was in public use, with his consent and allowance, for six years before he applied for a patent, on a certain avenue in Boston called the Mill-dam; and contended that said public use worked an abandonment of the pretended invention. . . .

The next question to be considered is, whether Nicholson's invention was in public use or on sale, with his consent and allowance, for more than two years prior to his application for a patent, within the meaning of . . . the acts in force in 1854, when he obtained his patent. It is contended by the appellants that the pavement which Nicholson put down by way of experiment, on Mill-dam Avenue in Boston, in 1848, was publicly used for the space of six years before his application for a patent, and that this was a public use within the meaning of the law.

To determine this question, it is necessary to examine the circumstances under which this pavement was put down, and the object and purpose that Nicholson had in view. It is perfectly clear from the evidence that he did not intend to abandon his right to a patent. He had filed a caveat in August, 1847, and he constructed the pavement in question by way of experiment, for the purpose of testing its qualities. The road in which it was put down, though a public road, belonged to the Boston and Roxbury Mill Corporation, which received toll for its use; and Nicholson was a stockholder and treasurer of the corporation. The pavement in question was about seventy-five feet in length, and was laid adjoining to the toll-gate and in front of the toll-house. It was constructed by Nicholson at his own expense, and was placed by him where it was, in order to see the effect upon it of heavily loaded wagons, and of varied and constant use; and also to ascertain its durability, and liability to decay. Joseph L. Lang, who was tollcollector for many years, commencing in 1849, familiar with the road before that time, and with this pavement from the time of its origin, testified as follows:

Mr. Nicholson was there almost daily, and when he came he would examine the pavement, would often walk over it, cane in hand, striking it with his cane, and making particular examination of its condition. He asked me very often how people liked it, and asked me a great many questions about it. I have heard him say a number of times that this was his first experiment with this pavement, and he thought that it was wearing very well. The circumstances that made this locality desirable for the purpose of obtaining a satisfactory test of the durability and value of the pavement were: that there would be a better chance to lay it there; he would have more room and a better chance than in the city; and, besides, it was a place where most everybody went over it, rich and poor. It was a great thoroughfare out of Boston. It was frequently travelled by teams having a load of five or six tons, and some larger. As these teams usually stopped at the toll-house, and started again, the stopping and starting would make as severe a trial to the pavement as it could be put to.
This evidence is corroborated by that of several other witnesses in the cause; the result of the whole being that Nicholson merely intended this piece of pavement as an experiment, to test its usefulness and durability. Was this a public use, within the meaning of the law?

An abandonment of an invention to the public may be evinced by the conduct of the inventor at any time, even within the two years named in the law. The effect of the law is, that no such consequence will necessarily follow from the invention being in public use or on sale, with the inventor's consent and allowance, at any time within two years before his application; but that, if the invention is in public use or on sale prior to that time, it will be conclusive evidence of abandonment, and the patent will be void.
But, in this case, it becomes important to inquire what is such a public use as will have the effect referred to. That the use of the pavement in question was public in one sense cannot be disputed. But can it be said that the invention was in public use? The use of an invention by the inventor himself, or of any other person under his direction, by way of experiment, and in order to bring the invention to perfection, has never been regarded as such a use. CURTIS, Patents, §381; Shaw v. Cooper, [32 U.S.] 7 Pet. 292 [1833].

Now, the nature of a street pavement is such that it cannot be experimented upon satisfactorily, except on a highway, which is always public.

When the subject of invention is a machine, it may be tested and tried in a building, either with or without closed doors. In either case, such use is not a public use, within the meaning of the statute, so long as the inventor is engaged, in good faith, in testing its operation. He may see cause to alter it and improve it, or not. His experiments will reveal the fact whether any and what alterations may be necessary. If durability is one of the qualities to be attained, a long period, perhaps years, may be necessary to enable the inventor to discover whether his purpose is accomplished. And though, during all that period, he may not find that any changes are necessary, yet he may be justly said to be using his machine only by way of experiment; and no one would say that such a use, pursued with a bona fide intent of testing the qualities of the machine, would be a public use, within the meaning of the statute. So long as he does not voluntarily allow others to make it and use it, and so long as it is not on sale for general use, he keeps the invention under his own control, and does not lose his title to a patent.

It would not be necessary, in such a case, that the machine should be put up and used only in the inventor's own shop or premises. He may have it put up and used in the premises of another, and the use may inure to the benefit of the owner of the establishment. Still, if used under the surveillance of the inventor, and for the purpose of enabling him to test the machine, and ascertain whether it will answer the purpose intended, and make such alterations and improvements as experience demonstrates to be necessary, it will still be a mere experimental use, and not a public use, within the meaning of the statute.

Whilst the supposed machine is in such experimental use, the public may be incidentally deriving a benefit from it. If it be a grist-mill, or a carding-machine, customers from the surrounding country may enjoy the use of it by having their grain made into flour, or their wool into rolls, and still it will not be in public use, within the meaning of the law.

But if the inventor allows his machine to be used by other persons generally, either with or without compensation, or if it is, with his consent, put on sale for such use, then it will be in public use and on public sale, within the meaning of the law.

If, now, we apply the same principles to this case, the analogy will be seen at once. Nicholson wished to experiment on his pavement. He believed it to be a good thing, but he was not sure; and the only mode in which he could test it was to place a specimen of it in a public roadway. He did this at his own expense, and with the consent of the owners of the road. Durability was one of the qualities to be attained. He wanted to know whether his pavement would stand, and whether it would resist decay. Its character for durability could not be ascertained without its being subjected to use for a considerable time. He subjected it to such use, in good faith, for the simple purpose of ascertaining whether it was what he claimed it to be. Did he do anything more than the inventor of the supposed machine might do, in testing his invention? The public had the incidental use of the pavement, it is true; but was the invention in public use, within the meaning of the statute? We think not. The proprietors of the road alone used the invention, and used it at Nicholson's request, by way of experiment. The only way in which they could use it was by allowing the public to pass over the pavement.

Had the city of Boston, or other parties, used the invention, by laying down the pavement in other streets and places, with Nicholson's consent and allowance, then, indeed, the invention itself would have been in public use, within the meaning of the law; but this was not the case. Nicholson did not sell it, nor allow others to use it or sell it. He did not let it go beyond his control. He did nothing that indicated any intent to do so. He kept it under his own eyes, and never for a moment abandoned the intent to obtain a patent for it. . . .

It is sometimes said that an inventor acquires an undue advantage over the public by delaying to take out a patent, inasmuch as he thereby preserves the monopoly to himself for a longer period than is allowed by the policy of the law; but this cannot be said with justice when the delay is occasioned by a bona fide effort to bring his invention to perfection, or to ascertain whether it will answer the purpose intended. His monopoly only continues for the allotted period, in any event; and it is the interest of the public, as well as himself, that the invention should be perfect and properly tested, before a patent is granted for it. Any attempt to use it for a profit, and not by way of experiment, for a longer period than two years before the application, would deprive the inventor of his right to a patent.

# COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS 

1. Compare the facts in City of Elizabeth to those in Egbert v. Lippmann, supra, the corset case. How did Nicholson's actions in this case differ from those of Barnes in the Egbert case? What evidence did Nicholson have regarding his six-year prefiling period that Barnes did not have for his comparably long period?
2. Could Nicholson simply have filed a patent application at the end of year one and prosecuted it while conducting his continued test? Would a patent have been granted on such an application? Note that because Nicholson was able to delay filing his application for six years, he received a patent that expired later and was therefore arguably more valuable to him than the patent he would have received if he had applied at the end of one year.
3. Factors to Be Considered. In a 2002 decision, the Federal Circuit provides a list of 13 factors collected from prior cases that are relevant to a finding of experimental use:
(1) the necessity for public testing, (2) the amount of control over the experiment retained by the inventor, (3) the nature of the invention, (4) the length of the test period, (5) whether payment was made, (6) whether there was a secrecy obligation, (7) whether records of the experiment were kept, (8) who conducted the experiment, (9) the degree of commercial exploitation during testing, (10) whether the invention reasonably requires evaluation under actual conditions of use, (11) whether testing was systematically performed, (12) whether the inventor continually monitored the invention during testing, and (13) the nature of contacts made with potential customers.
Allen Eng'g Corp. v. Bartell Indus., Inc., 299 F.3d 1336, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2002). The jurisprudence, however, makes clear that even one factor can be decisive. See Atlanta Attachment Co. v. Leggett \& Platt, Inc., 516 F.3d 1361, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (observing that lack of control over the invention during the alleged experiment, while not always dispositive, may be so); see also Clock Spring, L.P. v. Wrapmaster, Inc., 560 F.3d 1317 (Fed. Cir. 2009).
4. A 2005 Federal Circuit case applied the City of Elizabeth principles to a case involving "experimental sales." Electromotive Div. of General Motors Corp. v. Transportation Systems Div. of General Elec. Co., 417 F.3d 1203 (Fed. Cir. 2005). In this case, the patentee (GM) claimed planetary compressor bearings for use in turbochargers for diesel train engines. Pursuant to its standard development and testing procedure, GM used prototypes of its new bearing design in numerous train engines before the critical date. It also agreed to supply some bearings covered by one of its patents as spares to one of its customers if it needed them. Defendant GE argued that the sale of the train engines containing the new bearings, and the agreement to supply them as spares, constituted "on sale" activity under §102 (b). GM disagreed, and argued that because the bearings were part of its development and testing program, the customer's use of the engines with the bearings was covered by the "experimental use" of City of Elizabeth. The Federal Circuit sided with defendant GE:

When sales are made in an ordinary commercial environment and the goods are placed outside the inventor's control, an inventor's secretly held subjective intent to "experiment," even if true, is unavailing without objective evidence to support the contention. Under such circumstances, the customer at a minimum must be made aware of the experimentation:

We have generally looked to objective evidence to show that a pre-critical date sale was primarily for experimentation. . . . The length of the test period is merely a piece of evidence to add to the evidentiary scale. The same is true with respect to whether payment is made for the device, whether a user agreed to use secretly, whether records were kept of progress, whether persons other than the inventor conducted the asserted experiments, how many tests were conducted, how long the testing period was in relationship to tests of other similar devices. [T.P. Laboratories, Inc. v. Professional Positioners, Inc., 724 F.2d 965 (Fed. Cir. 1984)], at 971-72.
We agree . . . that a customer's awareness of the purported testing in the context of a sale is a critical attribute of experimentation. If an inventor fails to communicate to a customer that the sale of the invention was made in pursuit of experimentation, then the customer, as well as the general public, can only view the sale as a normal commercial transaction. . . . Accordingly, we hold not only that customer awareness is among the experimentation factors, but also that it is critical.

Our precedent has treated control and customer awareness of the testing as especially important to experimentation. Indeed, this court has effectively made control and customer awareness dispositive. Accordingly, we conclude that control and customer awareness ordinarily must be proven if experimentation is to be found.
417 F.3d 1203, at 1212-15 (citations omitted).

# vi. Priority Rules and First-to-Invent 

Having dealt with novelty, we turn now to the closely related topic of priority. Section 102(g) of the 1952 Act provides that "[a] person shall be entitled to a patent unless" (1) [inter partes proceedings] during the course of an interference . . ., another inventor involved therein establishes, to the extent permitted in section 104. . . that before such person's invention thereof the invention was made by such other inventor and not abandoned, suppressed, or concealed, or (2) [ex parte prosecution/invalidity defense] before such person's invention thereof, the invention was made in this country by another inventor who had not abandoned, suppressed, or concealed it.
In determining priority of invention under this subsection, there shall be considered not only the respective dates of conception and reduction to practice of the invention, but also the reasonable diligence of one who was first to conceive and last to reduce to practice, from a time prior to conception by the other.
Because the 1952 Act was a first to invent system, the law needed a mechanism to decide who among competing inventors was the first to invent. Section 102(g) considers four issues in deciding who is first to invent: conception, reduction to practice, diligence, and abandonment.

Conception occurs when an inventor possesses a definite idea of a complete and operative invention as it is thereafter reduced to practice. Reduction to practice occurs when the inventor establishes that the claimed invention works for its intended purpose. This can be proven through laboratory experimentation, construction of a prototype, or drawings explaining the operative elements of the claimed invention. Filing a valid, enabling patent application constitutes a constructive reduction to practice.

As the following timeline illustrates, Inventor B is the first to conceive the claimed invention represented by the lightbulb above her head illuminating. She begins her experimentation soon thereafter and eventually reduces the invention to practice, as illustrated by her synthesis of the drug compound (Rx). Inventor A later independently conceives the same invention and reduces the invention to practice relatively quickly. In fact, he can establish reduction to practice before Inventor B.
![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

As illustrated by the second timeline, notwithstanding that Inventor A is the first to reduce the invention to practice, the 1952 Patent Act grants Inventor B priority so long as she is reasonably diligent in her efforts to reduce the claimed invention to practice from a time prior to Inventor A's conception date, ultimately achieves a successful reduction to practice, and does not abandon, suppress, or conceal her invention.

An inventor "abandon[s], suppress[es] or conceal[s]" an invention by failing to pursue a patent or take steps to utilize or commercialize the invention. See Dow Chem. Co. v. Astro-Valcour, Inc., 267 F.3d 1334, 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Thus, a first inventor can lose priority if she fails to actively pursue her invention for a long enough time. See, e.g., Peeler v. Miller, 535 F.2d 647, 654 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (four-year delay between reduction to practice and filing of application constituted abandonment). Diligence concerns the inventor's conduct before reducing the invention to practice, while abandonment, suppression, or concealment only happen after an invention is reduced to practice.

Disputes over priority of invention arise in two contexts: (1) interference proceedings; or (2) as an invalidity defense. The same priority rule applies to both contexts. Section 102(g)(1) covers interference proceedings-formal priority contests between rival claimants who both want to patent the same subject matter. Such proceedings can take place at the PTO where an examiner or applicant determines that two pending patent applications cover the same invention. Subsection (2) covers the use of prior inventions as a source of prior art to defend against someone else's patent.
Besides the different contexts in which they arise, Sections 102(g)(1) and (2) differ in their territorial scope. The key phrases are "to the extent permitted in section 104" in (g)(1) and "in this country" in (g)(2). Section 104 allows proof of prior inventive activity in any country that is a signatory to the World Trade Organization (WTO). No proof of conception or reduction to practice in a non-WTO country can be entered in an interference, although this does not matter much since essentially all countries are in the WTO. (And even inventions from non-WTO countries may rely on their U.S. patent application filing date as their date of invention.) Contrast this with the language of (g)(2): only evidence of prior inventions made in the U.S. may be introduced.

Now you can understand why some interferences are so complex and can take so long to resolve. See, e.g., Standard Oil Co. (Indiana) v. Montedison, S.P.A., 664 F.2d 356 (3d Cir. 1981) (1981 decision affirming findings of a PTO interference based on a patent application on polypropylene polymer filed in 1953); U.S. Steel Corp. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 865 F.2d 1247 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (validity of same patent upheld in litigation 36 years after patent was filed). You can also appreciate why Congress jettisoned the first to invent approach in favor of a "first-to-file" priority system in the America Invents Act.

In general, priority under the 1952 Act goes to the first inventor who can show reduction to practice (and who does not abandon, suppress or conceal by waiting too long). Often, this is also the same inventor who can show first conception. Priority in this case is easy: the first to conceive and first to reduce to practice wins, period. A more complicated case arises when one inventor is first to conceive but last to reduce to practice.

Such a case triggers application of the last sentence of §102(~g), particularly the "reasonable diligence of one who was first to conceive but last to reduce to practice." In this special situation, as you will see in the following case, the first to conceive must prove an extra element to win priority-reasonable diligence.

# Griffith v. Kanamaru United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit 816 F.2d 624 (Fed. Cir. 1987) 

## NICHOLS, SENIOR CIRCUIT JUDGE.

Owen W. Griffith (Griffith) appeals the decision of the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences (board) that Griffith failed to establish a prima facie case that he is entitled to an award of priority against the filing date of Tsunco Kanamaru, et al. (Kanamaru) for a patent on aminocarnitine compounds. We affirm.

## Background

This patent interference case involves the application of Griffith, an Associate Professor in the Department of Biochemistry at Cornell University Medical College, for a patent on an aminocarnitine compound, useful in the treatment of diabetes, and a patent issued for the same invention to Kanamaru, an employee of Takeda Chemical Industries. The inventors assigned their rights to the inventions to the Cornell Research Foundation, Inc. (Cornell) and to Takeda Chemical Industries respectively.

Griffith had established conception by June 30, 1981, and reduction to practice on January 11, 1984. Kanamaru filed for a United States patent on November 17, 1982. The board found, however, that Griffith failed to establish reasonable diligence for a prima facie case of prior invention. . . .

The board . . . decided that Griffith failed to establish a prima facie case for priority against Kanamaru's filing date. This result was based on the board's conclusion that Griffith's explanation for inactivity between June 15, 1983, and September 13, 1983, failed to provide a legally sufficient excuse to satisfy the "reasonable diligence" requirement of 35 U.S.C. §102(~g). [The final sentence of 1952 Act §102(~g) reads: "In determining priority of invention under this subsection, there shall be considered not only the respective dates of conception and reduction to practice of the invention, but also the reasonable diligence of one who was first to conceive and last to reduce to practice, from a time prior to conception by the other."] Griffith appeals on the issue of reasonable diligence.

## Analysis

This is a case of first impression and presents the novel circumstances of a university suggesting that it is reasonable for the public to wait for disclosure until the most satisfactory funding arrangements are made. The applicable law is the "reasonable diligence" standard contained in 35 U.S.C. §102(~g) and we must determine the appropriate role of the courts in construing this exception to the ordinary first-in-time rule. As a preliminary matter we note that, although the board focused on the June 1983 to September 1983 lapse in work, and Griffith's reasons for this lapse, Griffith is burdened with establishing a prima facie case of reasonable diligence from immediately before Kanamaru's filing date of November 17, 1982, until Griffith's reduction to practice on January 11, 1984. 35 U.S.C. §102(~g).
On appeal, Griffith presents two grounds intended to justify his inactivity on the aminocarnitine project between June 15, 1983, and September 13, 1983. The first is that ... it is reasonable, and as a policy matter desirable, for Cornell to require Griffith and other research scientists to obtain funding from outside the university. The second reason Griffith presents is that he reasonably waited for Ms. Debora Jenkins to matriculate in the Fall of 1983 to assist with the project. He had promised her she should have that task which she needed to qualify for her degree. We reject these arguments and conclude that Griffith has failed to establish grounds to excuse his inactivity prior to reduction to practice.

The reasonable diligence standard balances the interest in rewarding and encouraging invention with the public's interest in the earliest possible disclosure of innovation. Griffith must account for the entire period from just before Kanamaru's filing date until his [i.e., Griffith's] reduction to practice. . . .

The board in this case was, but not properly, asked to pass judgment on the reasonableness of Cornell's policy regarding outside funding of research. The correct inquiry is rather whether it is reasonable for Cornell to require the public to wait for the innovation, given the well settled policy in favor of early disclosure. . . . A review of caselaw on excuses for inactivity in reduction to practice reveals a common thread that courts may consider the reasonable everyday problems and limitations encountered by an inventor. See, e.g., . . . Reed v. Tornqvist, 436 F.2d 501 (C.C.P.A. 1971) (concluding it is not unreasonable for inventor to delay completing a patent application until after returning from a three week vacation in Sweden, extended by illness of inventor's father); . . . De Wallace v. Scott, 15 App. D.C. 157 (1899) (where applicant made bona fide attempts to perfect his invention, applicant's poor health, responsibility to feed his family, and daily job demands excused his delay in reducing his invention to practice).
... We first note that, in regard to waiting for a graduate student, Griffith does not even suggest that he faced a genuine shortage of personnel. He does not suggest that Ms. Jenkins was the only person capable of carrying on with the aminocarnitine experiment. We can see no application of precedent to suggest that the convenience of the timing of the semester schedule justifies a three-month delay for the purpose of reasonable diligence. Neither do we believe that this excuse, absent even a suggestion by Griffith that Jenkins was uniquely qualified to do his research, is reasonable.

Griffith's second contention that it was reasonable for Cornell to require outside funding, therefore causing a delay in order to apply for such funds, is also insufficient to excuse his inactivity. The crux of Griffith's argument is that outside funding is desirable as a form of peer review, or monitoring of the worthiness of a given project. He also suggests that, as a policy matter, universities should not be treated as businesses, which ultimately would detract from scholarly inquiry. Griffith states that these considerations, if accepted as valid, would fit within the scope of the caselaw excusing inactivity for "reasonable" delays in reduction to practice and filing.

Griffith's excuses sound more in the nature of commercial development, not accepted as an excuse for delay, than the "hardship" cases most commonly found and discussed supra. Delays in reduction to practice caused by an inventor's efforts to refine an invention to the most marketable and profitable form have not been accepted as sufficient excuses for inactivity.
... [I]t seems evident that Cornell has consciously chosen to assume the risk that priority in the invention might be lost to an outside inventor, yet, having chosen a noncommercial policy, it asks us to save it the property that would have inured to it if it had acted in single-minded pursuit of gain.

Although we agree with the board's conclusion, it is appropriate to go further and consider other circumstances as they apply to the reasonable diligence analysis of 35 U.S.C. §102(~g). The record reveals that from the relevant period of November 17, 1982 (Kanamaru's filing date), to September 13, 1983 (when Griffith renewed his efforts towards reduction to practice), Griffith interrupted and often put aside the aminocarnitine project to work on other experiments. Between June 1982 and June 1983 Griffith admits that, at the request of the chairman of his department, he was paimarily engaged in an unrelated research project. . . . Griffith also put aside the aminocarnitine experiment to work on a grant proposal on an unrelated project. . . . Griffith made only minimal efforts to secure funding directly for the aminocarnitine project.

The conclusion we reach from the record is that the aminocarnitine project was second and often third priority in laboratory research as well as the solicitation of funds. We agree that Griffith failed to establish a prima facie case of reasonable diligence or a legally sufficient excuse for inactivity to establish priority over Kanamaru.

# COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS 

1. What would the result in the interference have been if Professor Griffith had reduced the invention to practice on November 16, 1982? (Recall that Kanamaru's filing date-and therefore, in this case, his effective conception and reduction to practice dates-was November 17, 1982.)

If Griffith had reduced to practice on November 16, 1982, would it matter whether he was diligent between his conception date (June 30, 1981) and his reduction to practice? If not, why not? (Pay attention to the language: "there shall be considered not only the respective dates of conception and reduction to practice of the invention, but also the reasonable diligence of one who was first to conceive and last to reduce to practice." Note that reasonable diligence is mentioned only in connection with "one who was first to conceive and last to reduce to practice.").

Assume that Kanamaru introduced the following evidence: a conception date of January 1, 1982, and reduction to practice on November 1, 1982. Assume also, as actually happened, that Griffith's reduction to practice came after Kanamaru's. With Griffith the first to conceive of the invention, is Kanamaru's diligence an issue under the last sentence of §102(~g)(1) ? Should it be?
2. Since Takeda Chemical, Kanamaru's assignee, is based primarily in Japan, it is reasonable to conclude that Kanamaru did the research leading to his patent application in Japan. This would explain the exclusive reliance on the patent filing date in this priority contest. Before 1995, and thus at the time this case was decided, foreign inventors could not introduce evidence of foreign inventive activity (e.g., conception and reduction to practice). In 1994, however, as part of the legislative package implementing the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPs) portion of the Uruguay Round negotiations under the GATT, Congress changed §104 to permit evidence of inventive activity taking place in any country that is a member of the World Trade Organization (the successor organization to the GATT) beginning in 1996. See Uruguay Round Agreements Act of 1994, P.L. 103-465, 108 Stat. 4809 (1994), at §531, codified at 35 U.S.C. §104.
3. Corroboration of Invention Dates. Due to the complexity of determining invention dates, the significant ramifications for patent ownership and validity, and the risk of fraud, courts require corroborating evidence of contemporancous disclosure that would enable one skilled in the art to make the invention. Mahurkar v. C.R. Bard, 79 F.3d 1572, 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1996). This typically comes in the form of laboratory notebooks witnessed and signed by skilled artisans.
4. Political Economy of First-to-Invent? As noted at the outset of this section, most countries in the world have long based priority on application filing date-a far simpler and clearer system. The U.S. first-to-invent regime has been premised on a philosophical preference for rewarding true first inventors, not those (presumably large corporations) who have the resources to file quickly. In fact, small inventors were the major lobbying group opposed to international harmonization. Many questioned, however, whether this philosophical benefit outweighed the additional administrative cost, complexity, and lack of clarity about who will win a priority contest. For many years, it was thought that most interferences were predominantly won by senior parties anyway. That conventional wisdom didn't prove true. See Mark A. Lemley \& Colleen V. Chien, Are the U.S. Patent Priority Rules Really Necessary?, 54 Hastings L.J. 1299 (2003) (finding that junior parties (second filers) have prevailed in 43% of interference proceedings resolved on priority grounds). Does this sway your thinking about the desirability of giving up the traditional U.S. "first to invent" standard? As we will see in the next section, the small inventors eventually lost this battle, but were able to retain a U.S. grace period.
5. Prior User Rights. Griffith and Kanamaru were well on their way to the same invention at roughly the same time. Under the Federal Circuit's decision, only Kanamaru gets a patent on the invention. What happens to Griffith? Not only is he not entitled to the exclusionary power of a patent on his idea, but Kanamaru can exclude him from using his own, independently developed idea. This result seems harsh, particularly where (as here) Griffith was working on his version of the invention long before the patent ever issued to Kanamaru.

To ameliorate this problem, Congress has since granted "prior user rights" to nonpatentees if they could show that they were using the invention well before it was patented by someone else. See 35 U.S.C. §273 (2011). Under §273, a person who uses an invention commercially more than one year before another applies for a patent or commences the AIA grace period may continue to use the invention despite issuance of a patent to the other person. There are a number of technical restrictions on the new prior user right, including non-transferability. See §273(c)(1)(B) (restricting transfer of prior user right to sale of an entire company or line of business). So far, only a handful of decisions, all district court cases, have interpreted the statute.

Are prior user rights a good idea? Do they unfairly weaken the patent grant? For an argument in favor of prior user rights, see Samson Vermont, Independent Invention as a Defense to Patent Infringement, 105 MiCH. L. REV. 475 (2006). If a prior user is permitted to continue their use, should the patentee be compensated somehow-say, by receiving a compulsory licensing fee from the prior user? See generally Stephen Maurer \& Suzanne Scotchmer, The Independent Inventor Defense in Intellectual Property, 69 ECONOMICA 535 (2002).
6. A Simpler Approach . . . Eventually. Under the AIA, all this complexity is swept away for patents filed on or after March 16, 2013. All that typically matters is who files first. The only exceptions are where the inventor publishes and files within a year of publication and where an invention is stolen or "derived" from the true inventor-as in the Evans Cooling case mentioned earlier. Even so, because the 1952 Act will continue to apply to patent applications filed prior to March 16, 2013, it is important to understand 1952 Act §102(~g) until at least March 16, 2033 and probably for some years after.

# vii. The America Invents Act Regime 

Congress shifted the U.S. from the 1952 Act first-to-invent regime toward the international first-to-file standard. The U.S. did not, however, adopt a pure first-to-file system. Importantly, it retained a one-year grace period for inventors in certain cases. As a result, it might be more apt to characterize the AIA novelty regime as a modified first to file regime: a first to file or publish regime so long as that inventor files within a year of disclosure.

From a practical standpoint, the new regime makes the following changes: (1) the critical date for most purposes is now the date that a patent application is first filed; (2) the prior art relevant to a given patent claim now consists of all references available under the statute prior to the filing date rather than the invention date, subject to a oneyear grace period for the inventor in some cases; and (3) priority contests between rival claimants to an invention will now be determined almost exclusively by looking to when each of the rivals filed their patent application. The discussion that follows elaborates these basic principles and describes how they compare to the operating rules that pertain to the old, 1952 Act, system of priority and novelty. We conclude this section with a series of problems that illustrate the differences between the 1952 Act and AIA regimes.

## a. The AIA: A Simpler Structure

Overall, the AIA provides a simpler structure than the 1952 Act. The distinction between novelty, strictly speaking, and the statutory bars under the 1952 Act is gone. The AIA eliminates the 1952 Act's awkward structure, in which the related but distinct concepts of novelty and statutory bars appeared in successive subsections of §102. This means the end of the repetition of various categories or types of prior art under the two subsections, 1952 Act §102 (a) and §102 (b)-"patented, printed publications" etc. It also means that the concept of a grace period, which had been buried in the structure and wording of 1952 Act §102(b), is more apparent in the AIA.
The AIA integrates novelty and statutory bars into a unified provision, AIA §102, which first states the rule that prior art appearing before the critical date deprives the inventor of his or her entitlement to a patent; then defines all categories or types of references that qualify as prior art under the AIA (AIA §102(a)(1) and (2)); then defines the critical date as the inventor's filing date (last phrase of AIA §102(a)(1) and (2)); and then, finally, identifies the grace period concept as an exception to the general rule that prior art appearing earlier than an inventor's filing date precludes patentability for the inventor's claimed invention.

# §102(a) NOVELTY; PRIOR ART. - 

A person shall be entitled to a patent unless- (1) the claimed invention was patented, described in a printed publication, or in public use, on sale, or otherwise available to the public before the effective filing date of the claimed invention; or (2) the claimed invention was described in a patent issued [to another] . . . or in [another's] application for patent [that is] published . . . [and that] was effectively filed before the effective filing date of the claimed invention.
(b) EXCEPTIONS.- (1) DISCLOSURES MADE 1 YEAR OR LESS BEFORE THE EFFECTIVE FILING DATE OF THE CLAIMED INVENTION. disclosure made 1 year or less before the effective filing date of a claimed invention shall not be prior art to the claimed invention under subsection (a)(1) if - (A) the disclosure was made by the inventor or joint inventor or by another who obtained the subject matter disclosed directly or indirectly from the inventor or a joint inventor; or (B) the subject matter disclosed had, before such disclosure, been publicly disclosed by the inventor or a joint inventor or another who obtained the subject matter disclosed directly or indirectly from the inventor or a joint inventor.
(2) DISCLOSURES APPEARING IN APPLICATIONS AND PATENTS.-A disclosure shall not be prior art to a claimed invention under subsection (a)(2) if- (A) the subject matter disclosed was obtained directly or indirectly from the inventor or a joint inventor;
(B) the subject matter disclosed had, before such subject matter was effectively filed under subsection (a)(2), been publicly disclosed by the inventor or a joint inventor or another who obtained the subject matter disclosed directly or indirectly from the inventor or a joint inventor; or (C) the subject matter disclosed and the claimed invention, not later than the effective filing date of the claimed invention, were owned by the same person or subject to an obligation of assignment to the same person.
[Subsection (c), "COMMON OWNERSHIP UNDER JOINT RESEARCH AGREEMENTS," deems subject matter disclosed and claimed by members of a joint research team to be "owned by the same person" under §102(b)(2)(C) above.]
The phrase "effective filing date" generally refers to the filing of a patent application that establishes priority under U.S. law. This includes an application filed only in the U.S., or at least first in the U.S., and also certain applications filed first in foreign patent systems that are, by virtue of compliance with international treaties and U.S. law, granted the benefit of a U.S. filing date though initially filed elsewhere. See AIA §3, at (a)(2)(i) (adding definition of "effective filing date" to §100 of the Patent Act).

# b. No Geographic Restrictions on Prior Art 

The AIA continues a longstanding trend by eliminating geographic distinctions in the definition of prior art. Under the 1952 Act, certain types or categories of prior art are within the prior art regardless of where they occur. Patents and printed publications are the best examples. Whether a patent is issued in Germany, Japan, or China, it is still within the prior art; so too with publications. But under the 1952 Act other types of prior art have geographic limits; only "on sale" activities that occurred within the U.S., for example, enter the prior art under the 1952 Act. Foreign sales are not within the prior art. The AIA eliminates geographic distinctions for all categories of prior art. Under the AIA, if an event or activity occurs that meets the definition of prior art, it is within the prior art for U.S. patent law-regardless of where it occurs.

## c. Novelty vs. Priority

The AIA highlights the difference between priority and novelty. Strictly speaking, priority is a question of who, as between two rival inventors, will obtain a patent for an identical invention. Priority, in other words, is a matter of "inventor vs. inventor"; whichever of the two is first (under the relevant rule) wins the patent. Novelty is a different matter. Novelty is a question of whether, as between an inventor and a piece of prior art, the inventor acts before or after the prior art enters the field. Novelty, then, is a matter of "inventor vs. prior art": if an inventor can show that he or she did whatever is required before a reference enters the prior art, the inventor gets a patent.

The AIA's first-to-file rule eliminates the need to decide which of two rival inventors actually invented first. In most cases, the only relevant question under the AIA is which of the two rival inventors filed first. (One exception is where the first filer learned of or outright stole the invention from another person; when that other person files a rival application, the PTO can undertake a "derivation proceeding" to sort out who is the rightful owner of the invention.) This eliminates the need for the expensive and drawn-out priority contests under the 1952 Act known as patent interferences.

## d. The AIA Grace Period

Calling the AIA a "first-to-file" regime is an oversimplification. Section 102(b)(1)(A) provides that an inventor is entitled to a one-year grace period if she discloses her invention first and then files within a year. This "inventor's own" grace period means that an inventor can do any of a number of acts before filing that would generally constitute prior art but still preserve the chance for a patent, as long as she files within a year. The §102(~b)(1)(A) grace period is stated as an "exception" to the general rule that these acts would be prior art because they occur before the filing date. Note, however, that this grace period applies only to the inventor's own prior activity.

Section 102(b)(1)(B) provides a broader one year grace period if the inventor makes a "public disclosure"-as opposed to just a disclosure-that is good for purposes of the U.S. patent system against anyone else. Thus, it is akin to the grace period that patent applicants enjoyed under the 1952 Act. The rationale behind this more robust grace period is that if the applicant discloses her invention publicly before anyone else, there is no way to tell whether subsequent disclosers made and disclosed an independent invention or derived their disclosure from the patentee's publication. As a result, the law gives an inventor who is first to publicly disclose the invention a one year grace period against anyone else. Note, however, that the public disclosure will bar the inventor from obtaining a patent in most parts of the world.

Although the courts have yet to rule on what is a public disclosure, it is apparent that Congress intended some sort of distinction here. One reading is that "disclosure" under AIA §102 means any prior art reference as defined by the extensive case law under the 1952 Act. This includes some fairly obscure types of disclosure such as secret sales and items used in public but not in any way discernible by the general public. "Public disclosure," by contrast, means only widely and freely available disclosures, not secret ones. Only public disclosures create a grace period good against the world rather than just the inventor's own activity. See Sanho Corp. v. Kaijet Tech. Int'l, 108 F.4th 1376, 1381-84 (Fed. Cir. 2024).

# e. Scope of Prior Art: On Sale or in Public Use 

As noted earlier, courts have drawn a distinction between patentee and third-party public uses depending on whether they are informing or non-informing/secret. Any public use of the patented technology by the patentee-whether informing or non-informing/secret-constitutes a public use, whereas only informing public uses by third parties qualifies as novelty-defeating public uses. This distinction puts added pressure on patentees to promptly disclose their technology through filing their patent application.

This distinction carries over into the AIA. Paralleling the 1952 Act, AIA §102(a) encompasses "on sale" and "public use" within the prior art references that defeat novelty. Helsinn Healthcare S.A. v. Teva Pharm. USA, Inc., 586 U.S. 123 (2019). Writing for a unanimous court, Justice Thomas stressed the importance of carrying forward established meanings for statutory language in the absence of clear Congressional intent to change them:

Congress enacted the AIA in 2011 against the backdrop of a substantial body of law interpreting [pre-AIA] §102's on-sale bar. . . .

Although this Court has never addressed the precise question presented in this case, our precedents suggest that a sale or offer of sale need not make an invention available to the public. For instance, we held in Pfaff [v. Wells Elec., Inc., 525 U.S. 55 (1998)] that an offer for sale could cause an inventor to lose the right to patent, without regard to whether the offer discloses each detail of the invention. E.g., id., at 67. Other cases focus on whether the invention had been sold, not whether the details of the invention had been made available to the public or whether the sale itself had been publicly disclosed . . . .

In light of this settled pre-AIA precedent on the meaning of "on sale," we presume that when Congress reenacted the same language in the AIA, it adopted the carlicr judicial construction of that phrase. . . . The addition of "or otherwise available to the public" is simply not enough of a change for us to conclude that Congress intended to alter the meaning of the reenacted term "on sale."
586 U.S. at 130-31. The Court reasoned that Congress would not have overturned substantial precedent by subtly relying on the "associated-words canon" to imply a new limit to "on sale" stemming from the mere "catchall" phrase "otherwise available to the public." Id. at 634 . While the specific issue in that case involved the term "on sale" and not "public use," it seems likely that the judicial interpretations of both terms from the 1952 Act apply with full force to the AIA given the Court's reasoning. Thus, the categories of prior art from the 1952 Act will have the same definition under the new statute. See Robert P. Merges, Priority and Novelty Under the AIA, 27 BERKELEY TECH. L. J. 1023 (2012); Mark A. Lemley, Does "Public Use" Mean the Same Thing It Did Last Year?, 93 TEX. L. REV. 1119 (2015) (both supporting this result).

# PROBLEMS 

## Problem III-2.

a. Alma conceives of a compound (TAU) in December 2011. She synthesizes the compound in February 2012. Entirely independently of Alma, Edgar publishes an article in Nature, a scientific journal, describing TAU on December 1, 2012. Alma files a U.S. patent application on April 1, 2013. Assuming that Alma's invention is useful, nonobvious, and adequately described, is her patent valid or invalid based on these facts in the United States?
b. Based on the facts in III-2a, suppose Edgar filed a patent application on April 2, 2013. Will he be able to get a patent?
c. Dylan conceives of a compound (UCB) in December 2011. He synthesizes the compound in February 2012. He publishes this research in SCIENCE, a scientific journal, on June 1, 2012. Entirely independently of Dylan, Katie publishes an article in NATURE describing UCB on December 1, 2012. Dylan files a U.S. patent application on April 1, 2013. Assuming that Dylan's invention is useful, non-obvious, and adequately described, is his patent valid or invalid based on these facts in the United States?
d. Stephanie conceives of a compound (QED) in December 2011. She synthesizes the compound in February 2012. Entirely independently of Stephanie, Klay publishes an article in Nature describing QED on December 1, 2012. Stephanic files a U.S. patent application on February 1, 2013. Assuming that Stephanic's invention is useful, non-obvious, and adequately described, is her patent valid or invalid based on these facts in the United States?
c. Anna conceives of a compound (MIT) in December 2011. She synthesizes the compound in February 2012. Entircly independently of Anna, Noah places MIT on sale in Europe on December 1, 2012. Anna files a U.S. patent application on April 1, 2013. Assuming that Anna's invention is useful, non-obvious, and adequately described, is her patent valid or invalid based on these facts in the United States?

Problem III-3. Lisa invents a remarkable process for manufacturing circuit boards that reduces the cost by 20% without any diminution in quality. She promptly files a U.S. patent application on April 1, 2013. Much of the electronics industry licenses Lisa's patent. Lisa learns that Drago Corporation is using her patented technology without a license in the United States. She sues Drago for patent infringement. Drago does not deny that it learned of the technology from Lisa's patent. In its trial preparation, however, Drago learns that Mizuki, a small Japanese company, had developed the identical process and used it to manufacture a component of a video game controller that it sold in Japan in 2010. Mizuki has since gone out of business. Based on this information, Drago files a motion for summary judgment asserting that Lisa's patent is invalid for lack of novelty. How should a court decide? What is the basis for the decision?

Suppose instead that Lisa had filed her patent application on March 1, 2013. How should a court decide? Is the analysis any different?
