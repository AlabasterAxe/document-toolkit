A design for an article of manufacture is patentable if it is novel, original, ornamental, and nonobvious. The PTO defines a design as "the visual characteristics or aspects displayed by the object. It is the appearance presented by the object which creates a visual impact upon the mind of the observer." U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Manual of Patent Examining Procedure, §1502.

Courts have interpreted "article of manufacture" broadly. The Court of Customs and Patent Appeals held that "a manufacture is anything 'made by the hands of man' from raw materials whether literally by hand or by machinery or by art" and found that a design created by the flow of water in a fountain was patentable. In re Hruby, 373 F.2d 997, 1000 (C.C.P.A. 1967); see, e.g., Gorham Mfg. Co. v. White, 81 U.S. (14 Wall.) 511 (1871) (silverware); In re Koehring, 37 F.2d 421 (C.C.P.A. 1930) (cement mixers); In re Rosen, 673 F.2d 388 (C.C.P.A. 1982) (furniture); Unette Corp. v. Unit Pack Co., 785 F.2d 1026 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (containers). While the patented design must be embodied in an article of manufacture, a design patent may be obtained for only part of an article. In re Zahn, 617 F.2d 261 (C.C.P.A. 1980) (holding that the shank of a drill bit was patentable under §171); but see Sarah Burstein, The Article of Manufacture in 1887, 32 Berkeley Tech. L.J. 1 (2017) (tracing the legislative history of the term "article of manufacture" and finding that it was a term of art that referred to a tangible item made by humans, other than a machine or composition of matter, that had a unitary structure and was complete in itself for use or for sale). Thus, the subject matter of a design patent is not limited to designs for discrete articles.

## i. Claim Requirements

Like utility patents and unlike copyrights, design patents are examined and not merely registered. See USPTO, Manual of Patent Examining Procedure, part 1500 et seq. The examination is significantly less searching than for utility patents, however, and the overwhelming majority of design patent applications are approved.

The §112 requirements of adequate disclosure and definite claiming also apply to design patents. See In re Owens, 710 F.3d 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2013). In the case of design patents, both disclosure and definiteness are accomplished through the drawings. Only one claim is permitted in design patent applications. This claim takes the form of "the ornamental design of the specified article as shown." Although only one claim is permitted, a design application may illustrate multiple embodiments of a design if they involve a single inventive concept. See In re Rubenfield, 270 F.2d 391 (C.C.P.A. 1959).

The USPTO requires an applicant to "designate the particular article" for which a design patent is sought, although the patent need not depict the article and can represent it generically (as in the case of surface ornamentation). In In re SurgiSil, 14 F.4th 1380, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2021), the Federal Circuit ruled that "[a] design claim is limited to the article of manufacture identified in the claim; it does not broadly cover a design in the abstract." Consequently, the design patent title (e.g., "ornamental design for a lip implant") limits the range of anticipatory prior art as well as the scope of infringing articles of manufacture.

The degree of specificity with which an applicant must describe and claim the article is not straightforward. For designs of "an ornament, impression, print or picture to be applied to an article of manufacture," an applicant may make a broad claim to the use of the ornament on more than one article. See In re Schnell, 46 F.2d 203 (C.C.P.A. 1931). In this case, the applicant must teach the manner of applying the design to show reduction to practice. For designs that consist of a shape or configuration for an article of manufacture, the claim and specification must be narrower. Id.

Drawings must contain a "sufficient number of views to constitute a complete disclosure of the appearance of the design." 37 C.F.R. §1.152(a) (2014). If the drawings are insufficient, a patent may be declared invalid under §112. The solid lines of a drawing define the scope of the claimed invention. The dotted or dashed lines merely provide context; they do not limit the scope of the claimed design. The illustration below reflects a typical design patent:

# ii. Novelty 

Novelty is established if no prior art shows exactly the same design. O.hl:On Prod., Inc. v. Just Toys, Inc., 122 F.3d 1396, 1404 (Fed. Cir. 1997). A design is novel if the "ordinary observer," viewing the new design as a whole, would consider it to be distinct from, rather than a modification of, an already existing design. See, e.g., Clark Equip. Co. v. Keller, 570 F.2d 778, 799 (8th Cir. 1978).

The claim is compared to the design disclosed in the allegedly anticipatory prior art reference, assuming that reference has qualified as prior art under the applicable provisions of §102. If the claimed design and the alleged prior art design are substantially the same, the alleged prior art design anticipates the claimed design. Designs are "substantially the same" when their resemblance is deceptive to the extent that it would induce the ordinary observer to purchase an article, supposing it to be the other. Door-Master Corp. v. Yorktowne, Inc., 256 F.3d 1308, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Once identity is established, a prior design will anticipate even though it is an article of different use or is in a non-analogous art. See In re Glavas, 230 F. 2d 447, 450 (C.C.P.A. 1956).

The experimental use exception to the §102 (b) "public use" and "on sale" bars has limited application to design patents. An ornamental design alone for an article of manufacture cannot qualify under the experimental use exception. In re Mann, 861 F.2d 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1988) ("obtaining the reactions of people to a design, whether they like it or not, is not experimentation"). However, where experimentation is directed to the functional features of an article, the use may fall within the experimental use exception. See Tone Bros., Inc. v. Sysco Corp., 28 F.3d 1192 (Fed. Cir. 1994).

# iii. Nonobviousness 

Like utility patents, design patents must also meet the non-obviousness requirement of §103. See Titan Tire Corp. v. Case New Holland, Inc., 566 F.3d 1372, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2009). Challenges to a design patent under §103 may include evidence from one skilled in the art regarding prior art references and whether and how those references would be combined to form a design that compares to the claimed design. The test for obviousness is different from the test for infringement and anticipation. Whereas the comparison of the claimed design to an accused article or potentially anticipatory prior art is seen through the eyes of the "ordinary observer," the comparison of the claimed design to the prior art for obviousness purposes is seen through the eyes of the "ordinary designer." High Point Design LLC v. Buyers Direct, Inc., 730 F. 3d 1301, 1311 (Fed. Cir. 2013); Apple, Inc. v. Samsung Elecs. Co., 678 F.3d 1314, 1324 (Fed. Cir. 2012) ("In addressing a claim of obviousness in a design patent, the ultimate inquiry is whether the claimed design would have been obvious to a designer of ordinary skill who designs articles of the type involved.").

Since the mid-1990s, the Federal Circuit applied a two-step process for the obviousness inquiry-(1) identifying a single prior art reference (the "primary reference") that was "basically the same" as the claimed design, In re Rosen, 673 F.2d 388 (Fed. Cir. 1982); and (2) if a Rosen reference was found, determining if it was obvious to modify it with other prior art references to arrive at the claimed design, Durling v. Spectrum Furniture Co., Inc., 101 F.3d 100 (Fed. Cir. 1996). This inquirydiffered substantially from the utility patent obviousness test reflected in KSR
International Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398 (2007) and Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City, 383 U.S. 1 (1966). In a 2024 en banc decision, the Federal Circuit overruled the so-called Rosen-Durling test, holdingthat the Graham/KSR obviousness test applied to design patents. See LKQ Corp. v. GM Global Tech., 102 F.4th 1280 (Fed. Cir. 2024) (en banc).

In determining the scope of the prior art, there is no threshold similarity or 'basically the same' requirement to qualify as prior art. Rather, an analogous art requirement applies to each reference. The analogous art requirement reins in the scope of prior art and serves to guard against hindsight. . . .
there is no basis for abandoning the underlying analogous art requirement for assessing nonobviousness of design patents and we return to a more flexible fact-based analysis of whether the references are analogous art in a manner similar to utility patents. This approach casts aside a threshold "so-related" requirement but maintains the threshold analogous art requirement.

For utility patents, we use a two-part test to determine the scope of analogous art: (1) whether the art is from the same field of endeavor as the claimed invention; and (2) if the reference is not within the field of the inventor's endeavor, whether the reference still is reasonably pertinent to the particular problem with which the inventor is involved. See Airbus S.A.S [v. Firepass Corp., 941 F.3d 1374, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2019)]. This is a fact-dependent inquiry that requires a case-by-case determination. id. ("Whether a reference qualifies as analogous prior art is a question of fact. . . .").

We conclude that the first part of this two-part test applies to design patents in a straightforward manner. In other words, analogous art for a design patent includes art from the same field of endeavor as the article of manufacture of the claimed design. . . . As we have held previously, " [t] he scope of the prior art is not the universe of abstract design and artistic creativity, but designs of the same article of manufacture or of articles sufficiently similar that a person of ordinary skill would look to such articles for their designs." Hupp [v. Siroflex of Am., Inc.. 122 F.3d 1456, 1462 (Fed. Cir. 1997)].
. . Prior art designs for the same field of endeavor as the article of manufacture will be analogous, and we do not foreclose that other art could also be analogous. Whether a prior art design is analogous to the claimed design for an article of manufacture is a fact question to be addressed on a case-by-case basis . . .

In applying Graham factor one, the scope and content of the prior art, a primary reference must be identified. Identifying a primary reference protects against hindsight because "almost every new design is made up of elements which, individually, are old somewhere in the prior art." [In re] Glavas, 230 F. 2d 447, 450 [(CCPA 1956)]. As noted above, this primary reference need not be "basically the same" as the claimed design. Rather, the primary reference need only be "something in existence-not ... something that might be brought into existence by selecting individual features from prior art and combining them, particularly where combining them would require modification of every individual feature." In re Jennings, 182 F.2d 207, 208 (CCPA 1950). The primary reference will likely be the closest prior art, i.e., the prior art design that is most visually similar to the claimed design. The more visually similar the primary reference design is to the claimed design, the better positioned the patent challenger will be to prove its §103 case. The primary reference will typically be in the same field of endeavor as the claimed ornamental design's article of manufacture, but it need not be, so long as it is analogous art. It is often the case that the primary reference alone does not render the claimed design obvious, and design elements from secondary prior art references may be considered. . . .

The primary and secondary references need not be "so related" such that features in one would suggest application of those features in the other but they must both be analogous art to the patented design. Consistent with KSR, the motivation to combine these references need not come from the references themselves. (rejecting a rigidly applied TSM test). But there must be some record-supported reason (without hindsight) that an ordinary designer in the field of the article of manufacture would have modified the primary reference with the feature(s) from the secondary reference(s) to create the same overall appearance as the claimed design.
