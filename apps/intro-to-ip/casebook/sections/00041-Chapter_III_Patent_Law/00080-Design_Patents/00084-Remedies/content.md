## i. Injunctive Relief

A design patent plaintiff must satisfy the eBay test for preliminary or permanent injunctive relief, just as in a utility patent case. Because the analysis focuses on the ornamental design depicted in the patent, the patentee must make a slightly different factual showing with respect to the first eBay factor, irreparable injury: the design patentee must show "some causal nexus between" the defendant's design and the plaintiff's alleged injury. Apple, Inc. v. Samsung Elecs. Co., 678 F.3d 1314, 1324 (Fed. Cir. 2012). It also is possible to demonstrate irreparable harm by showing "design dilution," meaning that the presence of similar substitutes diminishes the value of the patented design. Id. at 1325 (noting, however, that the lower court properly had not found design dilution in the case at bar).

## ii. Damages

After the Supreme Court ruled in Dobson v. Hartford Carpet Co., 114 U.S. 439 (1885), that the rug design patentee was entitled to just 6 cents in damages, Congress added a disgorgement remedy for design patent infringement. The modern provision, largely unchanged since the 1887 legislation, provides:

Whoever during the term of a patent for a design, without license of the owner, (1) applies the patented design, or any colorable imitation thereof, to any article of manufacture for the purpose of sale, or (2) sells or exposes for sale any article of manufacture to which such design or colorable imitation has been applied shall be liable to the owner to the extent of his total profit, but not less than $250, recoverable in any United States district court having jurisdiction of the partics.
Nothing in this section shall prevent, lessen, or impeach any other remedy which an owner of an infringed patent has under the provisions of this title, but he shall not twice recover the profit made from the infringement.
§289 (emphasis added). Thus, a design patent owner can obtain the infringer's total profits for sale of an article to which the infringing design has been applied, but no less than $250.

To establish profits under §289, the patentee need only demonstrate the defendant's total sales. The defendant typically then demonstrates what portion of those sales is not attributable to the infringing design. Importantly, §289(2) applies to any entity that "sells or exposes for sale any article of manufacture to which such design or colorable imitation has been applied." This means that distributors and retailers can be liable for their total profit, which likely far exceeds the manufacturer's total profit. Thus, design patent cases often give rise to indemnity disputes between manufacturers and retailers, because the possible total exposure for accused items with significant retail markups can easily surpass the manufacturer's total revenue, to say nothing of its total profit.

While §289 is an additional remedy available to design patent holders, a design patentee cannot "twice recover" an infringer's profits. See §289 ("Nothing in this section shall prevent, lessen, or impeach any other remedy which an owner of an infringed patent has under the provisions of this title, but he shall not twice recover the profit made from the infringement."). For example, a patentee is not entitled to both a reasonable royalty and the infringer's profits. See Catalina Lighting, Inc. v. Lamps Plus, Inc., 295 F.3d 1277, 1291 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Similarly, when a utility patent and a design patent are asserted against the same accused product, a patentee can only recover damages for the single infringing act. See id. at 1292.

In Samsung Electronics Co. v. Apple Inc., 580 U.S. 53 (2016), the Supreme Court tempered the disgorgement remedy by holding that ownership of a design patent on the rounded rectangular shape of an iPhone did not necessarily entitle Apple to Samsung's entire profit from the sale of competing phones embodying the patented design. The Court opened up the possibility that the physical shell of Apple's iPhone was a different "article of manufacture" than the software or hardware in the phone.

On remand, Judge Koh instructed the jury to identify the articles of manufacture to which Samsung applied Apple's patented designs based on the following factors:
(1) The scope of the design claimed in Apple's patent, including the drawing and written description; (2) The relative prominence of the design within the product as a whole; (3) Whether the design is conceptually distinct from the product as a whole; and (4) The physical relationship between the patented design and the rest of the product, including whether the design pertains to a component that a user or seller can physically separate from the product as a whole, and whether the design is embodied in a component that is manufactured separately from the rest of the product, or if the component can be sold separately.
Final Jury Instruction No. 29, Design Patent Damages-Article of Manufacture, Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., U.S. District Court, No. 11-CV-01846-LHK, 2017 WL 4776443 , at *19 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 22, 2017). Apple contended that the articles of manufacture to which Samsung applied Apple's patented designs were the whole phones. Samsung contended that the articles of manufacture are a component or collection of components of each phone. Specifically, for the D618,677 patent, Samsung contended that the article of manufacture was a phone's round-cornered, black glass front face. For the D593,087 patent, Samsung contended the article of manufacture was a phone's round-cornered, glass front face and surrounding rim or bezel. For the D604,305 patent, Samsung contended that the article of manufacture was a phone's display screen.

The jury awarded Apple $533 million for infringement of the design patents and $5.3 million for infringement of the utility patents, approximately 20% more than the verdict that Samsung appealed to the Supreme Court. The parties settled their sevenyear smart phone patent battle before a further appeal.

# COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS 

For most of the history of design patents, the articles of manufacture protected were generic products with decorative ornamentation. Many of the early design patterns covered area rugs and cast iron radiators and stoves. The ornamental design is what separated products in the marketplace. By contrast, some modern design patents cover complex, multi-component, technological goods, such as smartphones. Does it make sense to award the "total profit" for infringing articles? See Mark P. Gergen \& Pamela Samuelson, The Disgorgement Remedy of Design Patent Law, 108 CAL. L. REV. 183 (2020) (contending that the fragmentation of design patents creates substantial risk that disgorgement of "total profits" will yield grossly excessive awards); Mark A. Lemley, A Rational System of Design Patent Remedies, 17 Stan. Tech. L. Rev. 219 (2013) (arguing for reform of §289 to allow for apportionment). Note however that even though products such as mobile phones involve many components, and many design elements, the overall impression of the product is often largely a function of its design. Thus, even if some form of apportionment is reinstated, the value of design elements may prove to be substantial. For this reason, some commentators believe that the traditional "total profits" rule of §289 still makes sense. See Jason J. Du Mont \& Mark D. Janis, The Origins of American Design Patent Protection, 88 IND. L.J. 837 (2013).
