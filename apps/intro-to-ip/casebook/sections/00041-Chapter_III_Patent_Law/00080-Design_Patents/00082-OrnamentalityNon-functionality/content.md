From the mid- 19^th century until the turn of the 20^th century, the Patent Office and the courts vacillated on whether design patents could extend to functional design elements. See Peter S. Menell \& Ella Corren, The Design Patent Identity Crisis, 36 Berkeley Tech. L.J. 1 (2021). Lacking clear resolution of the scope of design patent protection, the Patent Office eventually pushed Congress to restore design patent law to its original limited purpose of protecting ornamental features of articles of manufacture. See S. Rep. No. 57-1139, at 1 (1902). Against the backdrop of confusion and disarray, Congress deleted the word "useful" from the design patent statute and replaced it with "ornamental." Act of May 9, 1902, ch. 783, ยง4929, 32 Stat. 193 (1902). Under the new Act, "Any person who has invented any new, original, and ornamental design for an article of manufacture" could apply for a design patent. These changes aimed to shift the focus of design patents to appearances and ornamentality and differentiate them from the domain of utility patents.

The 1902 legislation clarified Congress's intent to reinforce the channeling principle between design and utility patents through deletion of the word "useful" and insertion of the "ornamental" rubric. This change sought to limit design patents to original ornamental features and channel functional advances to the utility patent regime. In the first few decades following the 1902 Act, courts sought to evaluate the question of ornamentality directly, focusing on whether the design in question manifested artistic beauty and aesthetic appeal or by addressing the question of visibility of the design, namely, the "matter of concern" test. See e.g., In re Stimpson, 24 F.2d 1012, 1012 (C.A.D.C. 1928) (invalidating a design patent because it was "lacking in symmetry, wanting in grace, and destitute of any appeal to the senses or emotions"). This approach, however, put judges in the uncomfortable role of art critic. As an alternative, courts shifted their focus to the question of functionality-which became the prevalent test.

The Second Circuit's decision in Baker v. Hughes-Evans Co., 270 F. 97 (2d Cir. 1920), confronted the interplay of the utility and design patent regimes. The patentee sought to enforce both a utility and a design patent for an inset soap dish wall receptacle with a protruding lip that could be used as a handle.

Design Patent No. 50,291

In ruling that the design was ineligible for a design patent, the court explained that the lip receptacle is open to the criticism that its desirable features are functional rather than ornamental. Weisgerber v. Clowney (C.C.) 131 Fed. 477. It is true, as pointed out in Bayley, etc., Co. v. Standart, etc., Co., 249 Fed. 478, 161 C.C.A. 436, that the same device or article may exhibit patentable mechanical invention and a patentable design; but it is not true that the design can ever be used to appropriate (per se) the mechanical function. The two inventions must be separable; otherwise, it would be a contradiction in terms to grant two patents for them.
Baker v. Hughes-Evans Co., 270 F. 99 (citation omitted).
The court's recognition that a design patent can never be used to appropriate a mechanical function aligns with the Supreme Court's fundamental insight in Baker v. Selden, 101 U.S. 99 (1879), that it would be a "surprise and fraud upon the public" to grant the author of a book "an exclusive property in the art described." Id. at 102. Such is the exclusive province of the utility patent regime. Furthermore, the Second Circuit's recognition in Baker v. Hughes-Evans Co. that the functional and ornamental features must be separable anticipates the essential limitation on the scope of copyright protection for useful articles. See 17 U.S.C. ยง101 (limiting protection of "Pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works" to "artistic craftsmanship" . . . only to the extent that such design incorporates . . . features that can be identified separately from, and are capable of existing independently of, the utilitarian aspects of the article." (emphasis added)). We explore this doctrine in Chapter IV(C)(2)(ii).

In another early case, the Second Circuit observed in a relatively straightforward case invalidating a design patent that the design "does not seem to us to have been dictated by other than utilitarian considerations." Strause Gas Iron Co. v. William M. Crane Co., 235 F. 126, 131 (2d Cir. 1916). The plaintiff asserted both a utility patent and a design patent claiming mechanical and gas means for supplying air and gas for heating the solid ("sad") iron efficiently. The design patent application, filed two years after the utility patent application, claimed the outer shape of the iron. In affirming invalidation of the design patent, Judge Learned Hand explained:

If there be any room at all in the subject-matter for a design patent, the patentees have not found it. [The court described several similar prior art design patents.] The modification of these forms into the design patent does not seem to us to have been dictated by other than utilitarian considerations. To suppose that any inventive effort was necessarily addressed towards pleasing even a most rudimentary aesthetic susceptibility appears to us far-fetched. . . . We believe that any one starting to design sad irons with the art before him, and governed only by considerations of proportion and plan, would have had no difficulty in making the plaintiff's iron.
235 F. at 130-31 (emphasis added).
Other courts also found the "dictated by functionality" or "primarily functional" label to be a useful way of resolving easy design patent cases. See Menell \& Corren, 36 BERKELEY TECH. L.J. at 35-53. None of these cases, however, stated or implied that a design that was partially based on functional considerations or in which ornamental elements were inextricably intertwined with functional features was eligible for protection. They simply concluded that a design patent claim that was dictated by functionality or was primarily functional was clearly invalid.

Later cases, without referring back to the clear intent and logic of the 1902 Act, allowed this language to drift into a doctrine that liberalized design patent eligibility, extending protection to features that were both functional and ornamental. In In re Garbo, the CCPA reviewed an appeal from the decision of the Board of Appeals of the Patent Office which rejected an application for a design patent on obviousness grounds. The CCPA noted that a design may embody functional features and still be patentable, but in order to attain this legal status under these circumstances, the design must have an unobvious appearance distinct from that dictated solely by functional considerations. We do not find this situation here.
In re Garbo, 287 F.2d 192, 193 (C.C.P.A. 1961) (emphases added). The CCPA's terse statement left room for doubt as to the scope of design patent eligibility. What did it mean to say that a design patent "may embody functional features"? Did the CCPA imply that a design patent could extend to functional features so long as they were not "dictated solely by functional considerations"? Could a design that inextricably intertwined aesthetic and functional elements be eligible for a design patent? The regional appellate courts decisions were far more circumspect in communicating that design patents could not monopolize functional elements. See, e.g., Strause Gas Iron Co., 235 F. at 130-31; Applied Arts Corp. v. Grand Rapids Metalcraft Corp., 67 F.2d 428, 430 (6th Cir. 1933) (expressing concern about monopolizing conventional designs through design patent protection); Circle S Prods. Co. v. Powell Prods., 174 F.2d 562, 564 (7th Cir. 1949).

In 1980, the District of Minnesota in Bergstrom v. Sears, Roebuck \& Co. 496 F.Supp. 476 (D. Minn. 1980), applied an especially lax new test of design patent eligibility: whether "there are numerous possible design solutions" for the article of manufacture. The design patent claimed a series of side-by-side C-shaped tubes that function as both a fireplace grate and a heater. The design heats the ambient air by drawing cool air from the room into the tubes, which is then heated by the fire and then propelling the warm air from the top of the tubes. The court cited no authority for this test, yet it would soon gain favor at the Federal Circuit, which was established two years later and became the exclusive appellate tribunal for utility and design patent cases.

# L.A. Gear, Inc. v. Thom McAn Shoe Co. <br> United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit 988 F.2d 1117 (Fed. Cir. 2008) 

NeWMAN, CIRCUIT JUDGE.
Thom McAn Shoe Company appeal[s] the decision of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York holding [it] liable for design patent infringement . . .

## Background

In 1987 L.A. Gear designed a line of women's and girls' athletic shoes identified as the L.A. Gear's "Hot Shots" shoes. United States Design Patent No. 299,081 was granted on December 27, 1988 ("the '081 patent"). Figure 4 of the patent is shown:
![img-32.jpeg](img-32.jpeg)

In the summer and fall of 1987 L.A. Gear exhibited the Hot Shots line of shoes to retailers at trade shows, and announced that these shoes had been selected as L.A. Gear's "hero" or featured shoe line, on which major promotion and advertising would be focused for the ensuing year.

Designers employed by [McAn] used the L.A. Gear shoes as models for the shoes accused of infringement: a women's high top shoe sold in Thom McAn stores ...

Functionality [McAn] asserted at trial, and argues on appeal, that the design of the '081 patent is "functional" and that the patent is therefore invalid. . . .

A design patent is directed to the appearance of an article of manufacture. An article of manufacture necessarily serves a utilitarian purpose, and the design of a useful article is deemed to be functional when the appearance of the claimed design is "dictated by" the use or purpose of the article. In re Carletti, 328 F.2d 1020, 1022, 140 USPQ 653, 654 (CCPA 1964); Power Controls Corp. v. Hybrinetics, Inc., 806 F.2d 234, 238, 231 USPQ 774, 777 (Fed.Cir.1986) (patented design must be primarily ornamental). If the particular design is essential to the use of the article, it can not be the subject of a design patent.
[McAn] argues that each element comprising the '081 design has a utilitarian purpose: that is, the delta wing provides support for the foot and reinforces the shoelace eyelets; the mesh on the side of the shoe also provides support; the moustache at the back of the shoe provides cushioning for the Achilles tendon and reinforcement for the rear of the shoe; and the position of each of these elements on the shoe is due to its function. However, the utility of each of the various elements that comprise the design is not the relevant inquiry with respect to a design patent. In determining whether a design is primarily functional or primarily ornamental the claimed design is viewed in its entirety, for the ultimate question is not the functional or decorative aspect of each separate feature, but the overall appearance of the article, in determining whether the claimed design is dictated by the utilitarian purpose of the article.

That elements of the '081 design, such as the delta wing or the side mesh, also provide support for the foot does not mean that the specific design of each element, and the combination of these elements into the patented design, is dictated by primarily functional considerations. The elements of the design may indeed serve a utilitarian purpose, but it is the ornamental aspect that is the basis of the design patent. Carletti, 328 F.2d at 1022.

The district court remarked on the existence of a myriad of athletic shoe designs in which each of the functions identified by [McAn] as performed by the '081 design elements was achieved in a way other than by the design of the '081 patent. When there are several ways to achieve the function of an article of manufacture, the design of the article is more likely to serve a primarily ornamental purpose. See Avia Group International, Inc. v. L.A. Gear California, Inc., 853 F.2d 1557, 1563 (Fed.Cir.1988). It was not disputed that there were other ways of designing athletic shoes to perform the functions of the elements of the '081 design. In today's marketplace, the primacy of appearance in the design of shoes can not be ignored when analyzing functionality.

The district court found that the '081 design was primarily ornamental, and that the patent was not invalid on the ground of functionality. Clear error has not been shown in this ruling, which is affirmed.

# COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS 

1. What is the Federal Circuit's ornamentality/non-functionality test? Does it exclude a design that inextricably intertwines decorative and functional elements? Why isn't "the utility of each of the various elements that comprise the design" a key clue to the question of design patent functionality? What if an expert were to show that this combination of elements is synergistic and effective in achieving optimal support and performance for an athletic shoe? Does the court give adequate consideration to the functionality of the composite design?
2. Doesn't the "availability of alternative designs" test ensure that almost all designs that comprise a combination of elements will be eligible for design patent protection? See Peter S. Menell \& Ella Corren, The Design Patent Emperor Wears No Clothes: Responding to Advocates of Design Patent Protection for Functionality, 36 BERKELEY TECH. L.J. 231(2021); Christopher Buccafusco \& Mark A. Lemley, Functionality Screens, 103 VA. L. REV. 1293 (2017) (making this claim and arguing that the court has whittled functionality away to the vanishing point); cf. Ezaki Glico Kabushiki Kaisha v. Lotte Int'l, 986 F.3d 250, 260 (3d Cir. 2021) (observing that the availability of alternative designs does not make a design non-functional under trademark law).
3. Fidelity to the 1902 Act? Does the Federal Circuit's test for ornamentality: nonfunctionality comport with Congress's intention to ensure that functional advances are channeled exclusively to the utility patent regime? See generally, Peter S. Menell \& Ella Corren, Design Patent Law's Identity Crisis 36 Berkeley Tech. L.J. 1 (2021) (tracing the history of the ornamentality/non-functionality jurisprudence and highlighting that the Federal Circuit has never expressly considered the 1902 Act and its legislative history).
4. Interaction with Other Laws. As we will see, both copyright and trademark law also have rules that restriction protection for functional elements. But the modern design patent rule reads functionality so narrowly that the Federal Circuit has held the very same design elements to be functional under trademark law but nonfunctional under design patent law. Apple Corp. v. Samsung Elecs., Inc., 786 F.3d 983 (Fed. Cir. 2015). Does it make sense to treat functionality differently in different legal regimes?
