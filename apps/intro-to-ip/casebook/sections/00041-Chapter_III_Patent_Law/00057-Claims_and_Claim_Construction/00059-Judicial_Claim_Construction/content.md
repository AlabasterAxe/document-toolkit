The construction of patent claims plays a critical role in nearly every patent case. It is central to the evaluation of infringement and validity, and can affect or determine the outcome of other significant issues such as unenforceability, enablement, and remedies. The process by which courts interpret patent claims represents one of the most distinctive aspects of patent litigation.

In patent cases, as elsewhere, the distinction between questions of law and fact is an important issue. As we have seen so far, patent cases often center on scientific or technical details such as how an invention differs from the prior art, or how it works compared to a competitor's product. Whether a judge or a jury decides these key issues may make a significant difference in the outcome of a patent infringement case.

For most of the twentieth century judges, not juries, heard nearly all patent cases. Mark A. Lemley, Why Do Juries Decide If Patents Are Valid?, 99 VA. L. Rev. 1673 (2013). By 1995, though, approximately 75% of patent cases were tried to juries-partly a result of the shift in patent litigation from specialized patent boutique firms to general trial-oriented law firms. See ROBERT P. MERGES, AMERICAN PATENT LAW: A BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC HISTORY, 1790-PRESENT, Ch. 6 (forthcoming 2021). Many courts gave the question of the scope of the patent claim to the jury. One effect of this practice was to shroud the jury's claim construction in the black box of jury deliberations, making patent decisions especially difficult to review. Federal Circuit Judge Paul Michel lamented that " [w] hen the court delegates both construction and infringement to the jury's discretion, the jury is free to do almost anything it wishes." See Paul R. Michel, The Challenge Ahead: Increasing Predictability in Federal Circuit Jurisprudence for the New Century, 43 AM. U. L. REV. 1231, 1239 (1994). The question of who should determine the meaning of patent claims came before the Supreme Court in the seminal case of Markman v. Westview Instruments, 517 U.S. 370 (1996).

Markman sued Westview Instruments for infringement of its patent on a system for tracking articles of clothing in a dry-cleaning operation. After a jury found infringement, Westview Instruments moved for judgment as a matter of law on the ground that the patent and its prosecution history made it clear that the patent claims at issue did not extend to the Westview's accused device. The trial court granted the motion based on its examination of the relevant documentation. On appeal, the patentee asserted that the trial court's judgment violated its Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial on claim construction. Markman stressed that it had introduced expert testimony on the issue. Based largely on functional considerations, the Supreme Court held that claim construction is a matter for the court and hence beyond the province of the jury. The Court emphasized that judges are better equipped than juries to construe the meaning of patent claim terms, given their training and experience interpreting written instruments (such as contracts and statutes). Even though cases may arise in which the credibility of competing experts affects the determination of claim meaning "in the main," the Court anticipated that claim construction determinations will be "subsumed within the necessarily sophisticated analysis of the whole document, required by the standard construction rule that a term can be defined only in a way that comports with the instrument as a whole." Id. at 389. The Court also emphasized that judges can better promote uniformity and certainty in claim construction.

The Markman decision ushered in a new era and quickly led to the emergence of pre-trial "Markman hearings" to construe disputed claim terms. Following the lead of the Northern District of California, many of the most patent-intensive districts have adopted Patent Local Rules providing for joint, sequenced, staged, and timely disclosure of claim construction and other contentions, paving the way to a claim construction hearing within about eight months of the first case management conference. See generally Peter S. Menell, et al., Patent Case Management Judicial Guide, chs. 2 and 5 (Federal Judicial Center) (3rd ed. 2016). Most courts conduct a separate Markman hearing and issue a claim construction order before trial. Such hearings are often held in conjunction with a technology tutorial provided by the attomeys or technical experts. In many cases, such rulings provide the basis for summary judgment determinations on issues of validity and infringement.

Another effect of the Markman ruling was to bring claim construction out into the open. This has produced voluminous jurisprudence on how to construe claims. Within a few years, many litigants, lower court judges, scholars, and even some Federal Circuit jurists perceived claim construction law to be in chaos. Between 2000 and 2005, the reversal rate for district court claim constructions hovered in the mid-40 percent range. See J. Jonas Anderson \& Peter S. Menell, Informal Deference: A Historical, Empirical, and Normative Analysis of Patent Claim Construction, 108 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1, 40-41 (2014). A respected district court judge observed that given such a high reversal rate, "you might as well throw darts." See Anandashankar Mazumdar, Federal District Courts Need Experts that Are Good 'Teachers,' Judges Tell Bar, 70 Pat. Trademark \& COPYRIGHT J. (BNA) 536, 537 (Sept. 16, 2005) (quoting Judge Marsha J. Pechman of the U.S. District Court of Western Washington).

During this period, many perceived the outcome of claim construction decisions to be highly panel-specific. See R. Polk Wagner \& Lee Petherbridge, Is the Federal Circuit Succeeding? An Empirical Assessment of Judicial Performance, 152 U. PA. L. Rev. 1105 (2004). "Proceduralist" jurists on the Federal Circuit gave primary weight to the claim language, focusing on ordinary meaning derived from dictionaries. "Holistic" jurists drew upon the full range of interpretive tools-claim language, specification, prosecution history, dictionaries, and expert testimony.

The Federal Circuit granted en banc review in the following case to clarify and harmonize claim construction jurisprudence.

# Phillips v. AWH Corporation
United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
415 F.3d 1303 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc) 

## BRYSON, CIRCUIT JUDGE:

Edward H. Phillips invented modular, steel-shell panels that can be welded together to form vandalism-resistant walls. The panels are especially useful in building prisons because they are load-bearing and impact-resistant, while also insulating against fire and noise. Mr. Phillips obtained a patent on the invention, U.S. Patent No. 4,677,798 ("the '798 patent"). . . .

In February 1997, Mr. Phillips brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado charging AWH with . . . infringement. . . .
[In deciding] the patent infringement issue, the district court focused on the language of claim 1, which recites "further means disposed inside the shell for increasing its load bearing capacity comprising internal steel baffles extending inwardly from the steel shell walls." ... [Finding that the accused product did not contain "baffles" as that term is used in claim 1,] the district court granted summary judgment of non-infringement.

Mr. Phillips appealed [and a divided] panel of this court affirmed. Phillips v. AWH Corp., 363 F.3d 1207 (Fed. Cir. 2004). The majority [Judge Lourie, joined by Judge Newman] sustained the district court's summary judgment of noninfringement, although on different grounds. The dissenting judge [Judge Dyk] would have reversed the summary judgment of noninfringement . . . .
[T]he [original Federal Circuit] panel concluded that the patent uses the term "baffles" in a restrictive manner. Based on the patent's written description, the panel held that the claim term "baffles" excludes structures that extend at a 90 degree angle from the walls. The panel noted that the specification repeatedly refers to the ability of the claimed baffles to deflect projectiles and that it describes the baffles as being "disposed at such angles that bullets which might penetrate the outer steel panels are deflected." '798 patent, col. 2, 11. 13-15; see also id. at col. 5, 11. 17-19 (baffles are "disposed at angles which tend to deflect the bullets"). In addition, the panel observed that nowhere in the patent is there any disclosure of a baffle projecting from the wall at a right angle and that baffles oriented at 90 degrees to the wall were found in the prior art. Based on "the specification's explicit descriptions," the panel concluded "that the patentee regarded his invention as panels providing impact or projectile resistance and that the baffles must be oriented at angles other than 90 [degrees]." Phillips, 363 F.3d at 1213. The panel added that the patent specification "is intended to support and inform the claims, and here it makes it unmistakably clear that the invention involves baffles angled at other than 90 [degrees]." The panel therefore upheld the district court's summary judgment of noninfringement.

The dissenting judge argued that the panel had improperly limited the claims to the particular embodiment of the invention disclosed in the specification, rather than adopting the "plain meaning" of the term "baffles." [T]he dissenting judge contended, the specification "merely identifies impact resistance as one of several objectives of the invention." In sum, the dissent concluded that "there is no reason to supplement the plain meaning of the claim language with a limitation from the preferred embodiment." Consequently, the dissenting judge argued that the court should have adopted the general purpose dictionary definition of the term baffle, i.e., "something for deflecting, checking, or otherwise regulating flow," and therefore should have reversed the summary judgment of noninfringement.

This court agreed to rehear the appeal en banc and vacated the judgment of the panel. We now . . . reverse the portion of the court's judgment addressed to the issue of infringement.

# I 

Claim 1 of the ' 798 patent is representative of the asserted claims with respect to the use of the term "baffles." It recites: .

Building modules adapted to fit together for construction of fire, sound and impact resistant security barriers and rooms for use in securing records and persons, comprising in combination, an outer shell ..., sealant means . . . and further means disposed inside the shell for increasing its load bearing capacity comprising internal steel baffles extending inwardly from the steel shell walls. . . .

## II

The first paragraph of section 112 of the Patent Act states that the specification shall contain a written description of the invention, and of the manner and process of making and using it, in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains . . . to make and use the same. . . .
The second paragraph of section 112 provides that the specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention.

Those two paragraphs of section 112 frame the issue of claim interpretation for us. The second paragraph requires us to look to the language of the claims to determine what "the applicant regards as his invention." On the other hand, the first paragraph requires that the specification describe the invention set forth in the claims. The principal question that this case presents to us is the extent to which we should resort to and rely on a patent's specification in seeking to ascertain the proper scope of its claims. . . .

## A

It is a "bedrock principle" of patent law that "the claims of a patent define the invention to which the patentee is entitled the right to exclude." Innoval/Pure Water, Inc. v. Safari Water Filtration Systems, Inc., 381 F.3d 1111 (Fed. Cir. 2004)], at 1115. That principle has been recognized since at least 1836, when Congress first required that the specification include a portion in which the inventor "shall particularly specify and point out the part, improvement, or combination, which he claims as his own invention or discovery." Act of July 4, 1836, ch. 357, §6, 5 Stat. 117, 119. In the following years, the Supreme Court made clear that the claims are "of primary importance, in the effort to ascertain precisely what it is that is patented." Merrill v. Yeomans, 94 U.S. 568, 570 (1876). . . We have frequently stated that the words of a claim "are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning." Vitronics [Corp. v. Conceptronic, Inc., 90 F.3d 1576 (Fed. Cir. 1996)], at 1582. We have made clear, moreover, that the ordinary and customary meaning of a claim term is the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in question at the time of the invention, i.e., as of the effective filing date of the patent application.

The inquiry into how a person of ordinary skill in the art understands a claim term provides an objective baseline from which to begin claim interpretation.... That starting point is based on the well-settled understanding that inventors are typically persons skilled in the field of the invention and that patents are addressed to and intended to be read by others of skill in the pertinent art.

Importantly, the person of ordinary skill in the art is deemed to read the claim term not only in the context of the particular claim in which the disputed term appears, but in the context of the entire patent, including the specification.

# B 

In some cases, the ordinary meaning of claim language as understood by a person of skill in the art may be readily apparent even to lay judges, and claim construction in such cases involves little more than the application of the widely accepted meaning of commonly understood words. See Brown v. 3M, 265 F.3d 1349, 1352 (Fed Cir. 2001) (holding that the claims did "not require elaborate interpretation"). In such circumstances, general purpose dictionaries may be helpful. In many cases that give rise to litigation, however, determining the ordinary and customary meaning of the claim requires examination of terms that have a particular meaning in a field of art. Because the meaning of a claim term as understood by persons of skill in the art is often not immediately apparent, and because patentees frequently use terms idiosyncratically, the court looks to "those sources available to the public that show what a person of skill in the art would have understood disputed claim language to mean." Innova, 381 F.3d at 1116. Those sources include "the words of the claims themselves, the remainder of the specification, the prosecution history, and extrinsic evidence concerning relevant scientific principles, the meaning of technical terms, and the state of the art." Id. . . .

## 1

Quite apart from the written description and the prosecution history, the claims themselves provide substantial guidance as to the meaning of particular claim terms. See Vitronics, 90 F.3d at 1582.

To begin with, the context in which a term is used in the asserted claim can be highly instructive. To take a simple example, the claim in this case refers to "steel baffles," which strongly implies that the term "baffles" does not inherently mean objects made of steel. . . .
Other claims of the patent in question, both asserted and unasserted, can also be valuable sources of enlightenment as to the meaning of a claim term. Vitronics, 90 F.3d at 1582. Because claim terms are normally used consistently throughout the patent, the usage of a term in one claim can often illuminate the meaning of the same term in other claims. . . . Differences among claims can also be a useful guide in understanding the meaning of particular claim terms. . . . For example, the presence of a dependent claim that adds a particular limitation gives rise to a presumption that the limitation in question is not present in the independent claim. See Liebel-Flarsheim Co. v. Medrad, Inc., 358 F.3d 898, 910 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

# 2 

The claims, of course, do not stand alone. Rather, they are part of "a fully integrated written instrument," Markman, 52 F.3d at 978, consisting principally of a specification that concludes with the claims. For that reason, claims "must be read in view of the specification, of which they are a part." Id. at 979. As we stated in Vitronics, the specification "is always highly relevant to the claim construction analysis. Usually, it is dispositive; it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term." 90 F.3d at 1582 .

This court and its predecessors have long emphasized the importance of the specification in claim construction. In Autogiro Co. of America v. United States, 384 F.2d 391, 397-98 (Ct. Cl. 1967), the Court of Claims characterized the specification as "a concordance for the claims," based on the statutory requirement that the specification "describe the manner and process of making and using" the patented invention. . . . That principle has a long pedigree in Supreme Court decisions as well. [Citations omitted.]

## 3

In addition to consulting the specification, we have held that a court "should also consider the patent's prosecution history, if it is in evidence." Markman, 52 F.3d at 980. Like the specification, the prosecution history provides evidence of how the PTO and the inventor understood the patent. Furthermore, like the specification, the prosecution history was created by the patentee in attempting to explain and obtain the patent. Yet because the prosecution history represents an ongoing negotiation between the PTO and the applicant, rather than the final product of that negotiation, it often lacks the clarity of the specification and thus is less useful for claim construction purposes. Nonetheless, the prosecution history can often inform the meaning of the claim language by demonstrating how the inventor understood the invention and whether the inventor limited the invention in the course of prosecution, making the claim scope narrower than it would otherwise be.

## C

Although we have emphasized the importance of intrinsic evidence in claim construction, we have also authorized district courts to rely on extrinsic evidence, which "consists of all evidence external to the patent and prosecution history, including expert and inventor testimony, dictionaries, and learned treatises." Markman, 52 F.3d at 980, citing Seymour v. Osborne, 78 U.S. (11 Wall.) 516, 546 (1870). However, while extrinsic evidence "can shed useful light on the relevant art," we have explained that it is "less significant than the intrinsic record in determining 'the legally operative meaning of claim language.' " C.R. Bard, Inc. v. U.S. Surgical Corp., 388 F.3d 858, 862 (Fed.Cir. 2004)).

Within the class of extrinsic evidence, the court has observed that dictionaries and treatises can be useful in claim construction. . . . We have especially noted the help that technical dictionaries may provide to a court "to better understand the underlying technology" and the way in which one of skill in the art might use the claim terms. Vitronics, 90 F.3d at 1584 n.6. Because dictionaries, and especially technical dictionaries, endeavor to collect the accepted meanings of terms used in various fields of science and technology, those resources have been properly recognized as among the many tools that can assist the court in determining the meaning of particular terminology to those of skill in the art of the invention.

We have also held that extrinsic evidence in the form of expert testimony can be useful to a court for a variety of purposes, such as to provide background on the technology at issue, to explain how an invention works, to ensure that the court's understanding of the technical aspects of the patent is consistent with that of a person of skill in the art, or to establish that a particular term in the patent or the prior art has a particular meaning in the pertinent field.... However, conclusory, unsupported assertions by experts as to the definition of a claim term are not useful to a court....
[U]ndue reliance on extrinsic evidence poses the risk that it will be used to change the meaning of claims in derogation of the "indisputable public records consisting of the claims, the specification and the prosecution history," thereby undermining the public notice function of patents. Southwall Techs.[, Inc. v. Cardinal IG Co.,] 54 F.3d [1570] at 1578 [Fed. Cir. 1995].

# III 

Although the principles outlined above have been articulated on numerous occasions, some of this court's cases have suggested a somewhat different approach to claim construction, in which the court has given greater emphasis to dictionary definitions of claim terms and has assigned a less prominent role to the specification and the prosecution history. The leading case in this line is Texas Digital Systems, Inc. v. Telegenix, Inc., 308 F.3d 1193 (Fed. Cir. 2002).

## A

In Texas Digital, the court noted that "dictionaries, encyclopedias and treatises are particularly useful resources to assist the court in determining the ordinary and customary meanings of claim terms." 308 F.3d at 1202. Those texts, the court explained, are "objective resources that serve as reliable sources of information on the established meanings that would have been attributed to the terms of the claims by those of skill in the art," and they "deserve no less fealty in the context of claim construction" than in any other area of law. Id. at 1203. The court added that because words often have multiple dictionary meanings, the intrinsic record must be consulted to determine which of the different possible dictionary meanings is most consistent with the use of the term in question by the inventor. If more than one dictionary definition is consistent with the use of the words in the intrinsic record, the court stated, "the claim terms may be construed to encompass all such consistent meanings." Id.

The Texas Digital court further explained that the patent's specification and prosecution history must be consulted to determine if the patentee has used "the words [of the claim] in a manner clearly inconsistent with the ordinary meaning reflected, for example, in a dictionary definition." 308 F.3d at 1204. The court identified two circumstances in which such an inconsistency may be found. First, the court stated, "the presumption in favor of a dictionary definition will be overcome where the patentee, acting as his or her own lexicographer, has clearly set forth an explicit definition of the term different from its ordinary meaning." Second, "the presumption also will be rebutted if the inventor has disavowed or disclaimed scope of coverage, by using words or expressions of manifest exclusion or restriction, representing a clear disavowal of claim scope."

The court concluded that it is improper to consult "the written description and prosecution history as a threshold step in the claim construction process, before any effort is made to discern the ordinary and customary meanings attributed to the words themselves." Texas Digital, 308 F.3d at 1204. To do so, the court reasoned, "invites a violation of our precedent counseling against importing limitations into the claims." Id.

# B 

Although the concern expressed by the court in Texas Digital was valid, the methodology it adopted placed too much reliance on extrinsic sources such as dictionaries, treatises, and encyclopedias and too little on intrinsic sources, in particular the specification and prosecution history. In effect, the Texas Digital approach limits the role of the specification in claim construction to serving as a check on the dictionary meaning of a claim term. . . . That approach, in our view, improperly restricts the role of the specification in claim construction.

Assigning such a limited role to the specification, and in particular requiring that any definition of claim language in the specification be express, is inconsistent with our rulings that the specification is "the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term," and that the specification "acts as a dictionary when it expressly defines terms used in the claims or when it defines terms by implication." Vitronics, 90 F.3d at 1582.

The main problem with elevating the dictionary to such prominence is that it focuses the inquiry on the abstract meaning of words rather than on the meaning of claim terms within the context of the patent. Properly viewed, the "ordinary meaning" of a claim term is its meaning to the ordinary artisan after reading the entire patent. Yet heavy reliance on the dictionary divorced from the intrinsic evidence risks transforming the meaning of the claim term to the artisan into the meaning of the term in the abstract, out of its particular context, which is the specification. Thus, there may be a disconnect between the patentee's responsibility to describe and claim his invention, and the dictionary editors' objective of aggregating all possible definitions for particular words.
The problem is that if the district court starts with the broad dictionary definition in every case and fails to fully appreciate how the specification implicitly limits that definition, the error will systematically cause the construction of the claim to be unduly expansive. The risk of systematic overbreadth is greatly reduced if the court instead focuses at the outset on how the patentee used the claim term in the claims, specification, and prosecution history, rather than starting with a broad definition and whittling it down.

Thus, the use of the dictionary may extend patent protection beyond what should properly be afforded by the inventor's patent. . . .

Even technical dictionaries or treatises, under certain circumstances, may suffer from some of these deficiencies. There is no guarantee that a term is used in the same way in a treatise as it would be by the patentee. In fact, discrepancies between the patent and treatises are apt to be common because the patent by its nature describes something novel.

Moreover, different dictionaries may contain somewhat different sets of definitions for the same words. A claim should not rise or fall based upon the preferences of a particular dictionary editor, or the court's independent decision, uninformed by the specification, to rely on one dictionary rather than another. Finally, the authors of dictionaries or treatises may simplify ideas to communicate them most effectively to the public and may thus choose a meaning that is not pertinent to the understanding of particular claim language. The resulting definitions therefore do not necessarily reflect the inventor's goal of distinctly setting forth his invention as a person of ordinary skill in that particular art would understand it.

As we have noted above, however, we do not intend to preclude the appropriate use of dictionaries. Dictionaries or comparable sources are often useful to assist in understanding the commonly understood meaning of words and have been used both by our court and the Supreme Court in claim interpretation. . . .

We also acknowledge that the purpose underlying the Texas Digital line of casesto avoid the danger of reading limitations from the specification into the claim-is sound. Moreover, we recognize that the distinction between using the specification to interpret the meaning of a claim and importing limitations from the specification into the claim can be a difficult one to apply in practice. See Comark Communic'ns, Inc. v. Harris Corp., 156 F.3d 1182, 1186-87 (Fed. Cir. 1998) ("there is sometimes a fine line between reading a claim in light of the specification, and reading a limitation into the claim from the specification"). However, the line between construing terms and importing limitations can be discerned with reasonable certainty and predictability if the court's focus remains on understanding how a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand the claim terms. For instance, although the specification often describes very specific embodiments of the invention, we have repeatedly warned against confining the claims to those embodiments. See, e.g., Nazomi Communic'ns, Inc. v. ARM Holdings, PLC, 403 F.3d 1364, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (claims may embrace "different subject matter than is illustrated in the specific embodiments in the specification). In particular, we have expressly rejected the contention that if a patent describes only a single embodiment, the claims of the patent must be construed as being limited to that embodiment. That is not just because section 112 of the Patent Act requires that the claims themselves set forth the limits of the patent grant, but also because persons of ordinary skill in the art rarely would confine their definitions of terms to the exact representations depicted in the embodiments.

To avoid importing limitations from the specification into the claims, it is important to keep in mind that the purposes of the specification are to teach and enable those of skill in the art to make and use the invention and to provide a best mode for doing so. . . . One of the best ways to teach a person of ordinary skill in the art how to make and use the invention is to provide an example of how to practice the invention in a particular case. Much of the time, upon reading the specification in that context, it will become clear whether the patentee is setting out specific examples of the invention to accomplish those goals, or whether the patentee instead intends for the claims and the embodiments in the specification to be strictly coextensive. . . . The manner in which the patentee uses a term within the specification and claims usually will make the distinction apparent. . . .

In the end, there will still remain some cases in which it will be hard to determine whether a person of skill in the art would understand the embodiments to define the outer limits of the claim term or merely to be exemplary in nature. While that task may present difficulties in some cases, we nonetheless believe that attempting to resolve that problem in the context of the particular patent is likely to capture the scope of the actual invention more accurately than either strictly limiting the scope of the claims to the embodiments disclosed in the specification or divorcing the claim language from the specification.

In Vitronics, we did not attempt to provide a rigid algorithm for claim construction, but simply attempted to explain why, in general, certain types of evidence are more valuable than others. Today, we adhere to that approach and reaffirm the approach to claim construction outlined in that case, in Markman, and in Innova. We now turn to the application of those principles to the case at bar.

# IV 

A The critical language of claim 1 of the ' 798 patent-"further means disposed inside the shell for increasing its load bearing capacity comprising internal steel baffles extending inwardly from the steel shell walls"-imposes three clear requirements with respect to the baffles. First, the baffles must be made of steel. Second, they must be part of the load-bearing means for the wall section. Third, they must be pointed inward from the walls. Both parties, stipulating to a dictionary definition, also conceded that the term "baffles" refers to objects that check, impede, or obstruct the flow of something. The intrinsic evidence confirms that a person of skill in the art would understand that the term "baffles," as used in the ' 798 patent, would have that generic meaning.

The other claims of the ' 798 patent specify particular functions to be served by the baffles. For example, dependent claim 2 states that the baffles may be "oriented with the panel sections disposed at angles for deflecting projectiles such as bullets able to penetrate the steel plates." The inclusion of such a specific limitation on the term "baffles" in claim 2 makes it likely that the patentee did not contemplate that the term "baffles" already contained that limitation. See Dow Chem. Co. v. United States, 226 F.3d 1334, 1341-42 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (concluding that an independent claim should be given broader scope than a dependent claim to avoid rendering the dependent claim redundant). Independent claim 17 further supports that proposition. It states that baffles are placed "projecting inwardly from the outer shell at angles tending to deflect projectiles that penetrate the outer shell." That limitation would be unnecessary if persons of skill in the art understood that the baffles inherently served such a function.... Dependent claim 6 provides an additional requirement for the baffles, stating that "the internal baffles of both outer panel sections overlap and interlock at angles providing deflector panels extending from one end of the module to the other." If the baffles recited in claim 1 were inherently placed at specific angles, or interlocked to form an intermediate barrier, claim 6 would be redundant.

The specification further supports the conclusion that persons of ordinary skill in the art would understand the baffles recited in the ' 798 patent to be load-bearing objects that serve to check, impede, or obstruct flow. At several points, the specification discusses positioning the baffles so as to deflect projectiles. See '798 patent, col. 2, 11. 13-15; id., col. 5, 11. 17-19. The patent states that one advantage of the invention over the prior art is that "there have not been effective ways of dealing with these powerful impact weapons with inexpensive housing." Id., col. 3, 11. 28-30. While that statement makes clear the invention envisions baffles that serve that function, it does not imply that in order to qualify as baffles within the meaning of the claims, the internal support structures must serve the projectile-deflecting function in all the embodiments of all the claims. The specification must teach and enable all the claims, and the section of the written description discussing the use of baffles to deflect projectiles serves that purpose for claims 2,6,17, and 23 , which specifically claim baffles that deflect projectiles. . . .

The specification discusses several other purposes served by the baffles. For example, the baffles are described as providing structural support. The patent states that one way to increase load-bearing capacity is to use "at least in part inwardly directed steel baffles 15,16 ." '798 patent, col. 4, 11. 14-15. The baffle 16 is described as a "strengthening triangular baffle." Id., col. 4, line 37. Importantly, Figures 4 and 6 do not show the baffles as part of an "intermediate interlocking, but not solid, internal barrier." In those figures, the baffle 16 simply provides structural support for one of the walls, as depicted below:
![img-12.jpeg](img-12.jpeg)

FIG. 4
![img-13.jpeg](img-13.jpeg)

FIG. 6
Other uses for the baffles are listed in the specification as well. In Figure 7, the overlapping flanges "provide for overlapping and interlocking the baffles to produce substantially an intermediate barrier wall between the opposite [wall] faces":
![img-14.jpeg](img-14.jpeg)

FIG. 7
'798 patent, col. 5, 11. 26-29. Those baffles thus create small compartments that can be filled with either sound and thermal insulation or rock and gravel to stop projectiles. Id., col. 5, 11. 29-34. By separating the interwall area into compartments (See, e.g., compartment 55 in Figure 7), the user of the modules can choose different types of material for each compartment, so that the module can be "easily custom tailored for the specific needs of each installation." Id., col. 5, 11. 36-37. When material is placed into the wall during installation, the baffles obstruct the flow of material from one compartment to another so that this "custom tailoring" is possible.

The fact that the written description of the ' 798 patent sets forth multiple objectives to be served by the baffles recited in the claims confirms that the term "baffles" should not be read restrictively to require that the baffles in each case serve all of the recited functions. We have held that "the fact that a patent asserts that an invention achieves several objectives does not require that each of the claims be construed as limited to structures that are capable of achieving all of the objectives." Liebel-Flarsheim, 358 F.3d at 908. . . Although deflecting projectiles is one of the advantages of the baffles of the ' 798 patent, the patent does not require that the inward extending structures always be capable of performing that function. Accordingly, we conclude that a person of skill in the art would not interpret the disclosure and claims of the ' 798 patent to mean that a structure extending inward from one of the wall faces is a "baffle" if it is at an acute or obtuse angle, but is not a "baffle" if it is disposed at a right angle.

Invoking the principle that "claims should be so construed, if possible, as to sustain their validity," Rhine v. Casio, Inc., 183 F.3d 1342, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 1999), AWH argues that the term "baffles" should be given a restrictive meaning because if the term is not construed restrictively, the asserted claims would be invalid.

While we have acknowledged the maxim that claims should be construed to preserve their validity, we have not applied that principle broadly, and we have certainly not endorsed a regime in which validity analysis is a regular component of claim construction. . . . Instead, we have limited the maxim to cases in which "the court concludes, after applying all the available tools of claim construction, that the claim is still ambiguous." Liebel-Flarsheim, 358 F.3d at 911 . In such cases, we have looked to whether it is reasonable to infer that the PTO would not have issued an invalid patent, and that the ambiguity in the claim language should therefore be resolved in a manner that would preserve the patent's validity.

In this case . . . the claim term at issue is not ambiguous. Thus, it can be construed without the need to consider whether one possible construction would render the claim invalid while the other would not. The doctrine of construing claims to preserve their validity, a doctrine of limited utility in any event, therefore has no applicability here.

In sum, we reject AWH's arguments in favor of a restrictive definition of the term "baffles." Because we disagree with the district court's claim construction, we reverse the summary judgment of noninfringement. In light of our decision on claim construction, it is necessary to remand the infringement claims to the district court for further proceedings.
MAYER, Circuit Judge, with whom NEWMAN, Circuit Judge, joins, dissenting.
Now more than ever I am convinced of the futility, indeed the absurdity, of this court's persistence in adhering to the falsehood that claim construction is a matter of law devoid of any factual component. Because any attempt to fashion a coherent standard under this regime is pointless, as illustrated by our many failed attempts to do so, I dissent.

This court was created for the purpose of bringing consistency to the patent field. See H.R. REP. No 312, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. 20-23 (1981). Instead, we have taken this noble mandate, to reinvigorate the patent and introduce predictability to the field, and focused inappropriate power in this court. In our quest to elevate our importance, we have, however, disregarded our role as an appellate court; the resulting mayhem has seriously undermined the legitimacy of the process, if not the integrity of the institution.

In the name of uniformity, Cybor Corp. v. FAS Technologies, Inc., 138 F.3d 1448 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (en banc), held that claim construction does not involve subsidiary or underlying questions of fact and that we are, therefore, unbridled by either the expertise or efforts of the district court. What we have wrought, instead, is the substitution of a black box, as it so pejoratively has been said of the jury, with the black hole of this court. Out of this void we emit "legal" pronouncements by way of "interpretive necromancy"; these rulings resemble reality, if at all, only by chance. Regardless, and with a blind eye to the consequences, we continue to struggle under this irrational and reckless regime, trying every alternative-dictionaries first, dictionaries second, never dictionaries, etc., etc., etc.

Again today we vainly attempt to establish standards by which this court will interpret claims. But after proposing no fewer than seven questions, receiving more than thirty amici curiae bricfs, and whipping the bar into a frenzy of expectation, we say nothing new, but merely restate what has become the practice over the last ten yearsthat we will decide cases according to whatever mode or method results in the outcome we desire, or at least allows us a seemingly plausible way out of the case. I am not surprised by this. Indeed, there can be no workable standards by which this court will interpret claims so long as we are blind to the factual component of the task.

While this court may persist in the delusion that claim construction is a purely legal determination, unaffected by underlying facts, it is plainly not the case. Claim construction is, or should be, made in context: a claim should be interpreted both from the perspective of one of ordinary skill in the art and in view of the state of the art at the time of invention. . . . These questions, which are critical to the correct interpretation of a claim, are inherently factual. They are hotly contested by the parties, not by resort to case law as one would expect for legal issues, but based on testimony and documentary evidence. During so called Markman "hearings," which are often longer than jury trials, parties battle over experts offering conflicting evidence regarding who qualifies as one of ordinary skill in the art; the meaning of patent terms to that person; the state of the art at the time of the invention; contradictory dictionary definitions and [specifically] which [particular dictionary to use, when more than one was available at the time] would be consulted by the skilled artisan; the scope of specialized terms; the problem a patent was solving; what is related or pertinent art; whether a construction was disallowed during prosecution; how one of skill in the art would understand statements during prosecution; and on and on. In order to reconcile the parties' inconsistent submissions and arrive at a sound interpretation, the district court is required to sift through and weigh volumes of evidence. While this court treats the district court as an intake clerk, whose only role is to collect, shuffle and collate evidence, the reality, as revealed by conventional practice, is far different.

If we persist in deciding the subsidiary factual components of claim construction without deference, there is no reason why litigants should be required to parade their evidence before the district courts or for district courts to waste time and resources evaluating such evidence. . . . If the proceedings before the district court are merely a "tryout on the road," [citation omitted] . . . as they are under our current regimen, it is wasteful to require such proceedings at all. Instead, all patent cases could be filed in this court; we would determine whether claim construction is necessary, and, if so, the meaning of the claims. Those few cases in which claim construction is not dispositive can be remanded to the district court for trial. In this way, we would at least eliminate the time and expense of the charade currently played out before the district court.
Eloquent words can mask much mischief. The court's opinion today is akin to rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic-the orchestra is playing as if nothing is amiss, but the ship is still heading for Davey Jones' locker.

# COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS 

1. Clarifying Claim Construction Standards. The Phillips case represents the most comprehensive statement of claim construction principles:

Perspective: Claims are construed from the standpoint of the PHOSITA.
Time Period: Claims are construed as of the time of the invention (or the effective filing date; the court treats the two dates as interchangeable, although they are not) Evidentiary Sources:

- Intrinsic Evidence (claims, specification and prosecution history) shall be the principal basis for construing claims - Extrinsic Evidence (expert testimony, dictionaries) are permissible sources, but cannot contradict intrinsic evidence - There is no presumption in favor of dictionary definitions - There is no heavy presumption in favor of ordinary meaning 2. Are Embodiments Merely Examples or Limitations? In many construction disputes, including Phillips, the dispute boils down to whether the claimed invention is limited to the embodiments (i.e., the examples set forth in the specification) or are those embodiments merely illustrative. While recognizing that " [t] here is sometimes a fine line between reading a claim in light of the specification, and reading a limitation into the claim from the specification," the court nonetheless observes that "[m]uch of the time, upon reading the specification [from the perspective of a PHOSITA], it will become clear whether the patentee is setting out specific examples of the invention to [teach how to make and use the invention], or whether the patentee instead intends for the claims and the embodiments in the specification to be strictly coextensive. The manner in which the patentee uses a term within the specification and claims usually will make the distinction apparent." In reality, however, patent drafters are often intentionally vague about this issue so as to leave flexibility to argue either that the claim should not be limited so to ensnare the alleged infringer or should be limited to the embodiments to avoid prior art.

The Phillips court emphasized that "although the specification often describes very specific embodiments of the invention, we have repeatedly warned against confining the claims to those embodiments. In particular, we have expressly rejected the contention that if a patent describes only a single embodiment, the claims of the patent must be construed as being limited to that embodiment."
3. Meaning and Certainty. Federal Circuit cases have had to decide plausible disagreements over the meanings of the words "a," North American Vaccine, Inc. v. American Cyanamid Co., 7 F.3d 1571, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1993); contra Traxcell Techs., LLC v. Nokia Solutions, 15 F.4th 1136 (Fed. Cir. 2021); "or," Kustom Signals, Inc. v. Applied Concepts, Inc., 264 F.3d 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2001) "to," Cybor Corp. v. FAS Technologies, Inc., 138 F.3d 1448, 1459 (Fed. Cir. 1998); "including," Toro Co. v. White Consolidated Industries, Inc., 199 F.3d 1295 (Fed. Cir. 1999); and "through," Sage Products, Inc. v. Devon Industries, Inc., 126 F.3d 1420 (Fed. Cir. 1997), to name but a few, suggesting that even words we think have clear meanings may be subject to interpretation.

Given this, does the focus on the words of the claim make sense at all? Some scholars have argued that the claim construction process is irretrievably broken because it focuses on malleable words chosen by lawyers rather than on what the patentee actually invented. See Dan L. Burk \& Mark A. Lemley, Fence Posts or Sign Posts? Rethinking Patent Claim Construction, 157 U. PA. L. REV. 1743 (2009).
4. Does a Court Have to Construe Each and Every Word in a Disputed Claim? The answer has traditionally been no. See U.S. Surgical Corp. v. Ethicon, Inc., 103 F.3d 1554, 1568 (Fed. Cir. 1997) ("Claim construction is a matter of resolution of disputed meanings and technical scope, to clarify and when necessary to explain what the patentee covered by the claims, for use in the determination of infringement. It is not an obligatory exercise in redundancy."); Acumed LLC v. Stryker Corp., 483 F.3d 800, 806 (Fed. Cir. 2007) ("[A] sound claim construction need not always purge every shred of ambiguity. The resolution of some line-drawing problems-especially easy ones like this one-is properly left to the trier of fact."). Federal judges regularly limit the number of disputed terms they will construe. See Peter S. Menell, et al., Patent Case MANAGEMENT JUDICIAL GUIDE §5.1.2. (Federal Judicial Center) (3rd ed. 2016) (discussing mechanisms for limiting the number of claim terms to construe).

Increasingly, however, the Federal Circuit has emphasized that when the parties have a dispute over the scope of the claim, it is the district court, not the jury, that must resolve that dispute. See O2 Micro Int'l v. Beyond Innovation Tech. Co., 521 F.3d 1351, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (although "district courts are not (and should not be) required to construe every limitation present in a patent's asserted claims," the court must interpret the scope of any claim term for which the parties have presented a "fundamental dispute"); EON IP Corp. v. Silver Spring Networks, 815 F.3d 1314 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (reversing district court for failing to construe the terms "mobile" and "portable" when it was evident the parties gave those terms different meanings).

Does it make sense to construe ordinary English terms, as opposed to technical terms a jury might not be expected to understand? Does construing non-technical terms encroach upon the jury's prerogative to determine infringement?
5. Meaning as of When? At what point in time should a court consider the meaning of a claim term-when the claim was filed in a patent application, at the time the infringement took place, or some other time? PC Connector Solutions LLC v. SmartDisk Corp., 406 F.3d 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2005), holds that the claim words "conventional," "traditional," and "standard" should be interpreted as being temporally limited to the conventions, traditions, and standards that existed at the time when the patent was filed. The patent at issue covered a device for connecting peripheral devices to a computer via the computer's disk drive. Claim 1 of the patent is representative:
1. In combination a computer having a diskette drive, an end user computer peripheral device having an input/output port normally connectible to a conventional computer input/output port, and a coupler which couples the computer with the end user computer peripheral device without using a conventional computer input/output port: said coupler being sized and shaped for insertion within the diskette drive of the computer ... whereby data is transferred from said computer to said end user computer peripheral device via said read/write head of said computer, said coupler, and said input/output port of said end user computer peripheral device.
The accused devices in the case were couplers to link peripheral devices through a computer disk drive, but the couplers were designed to handle a particular class of peripheral devices-flash memories and smart cards that have flat, planar surface contact electrodes as their normal connecting elements (connectors radically different from the sort of multi-pronged connectors conventional in 1988). The court held that the accused devices could not infringe the patent because the relevant claim language limited the invention to an adapter for peripheral devices having 1988-style connectors:

We find nothing in the written description that amounts to a clear attempt by the patentee to impart any special meaning to the words "normally," "conventional," "traditionally," or "standard." Likewise, in the prosecution history, we do not read the patentability arguments that were made specifically to distinguish a test fixture as having effected the particular redefinition now advanced on appeal. As a consequence, the terms "normally," "conventional," "traditionally," and "standard" are governed by their ordinary and customary meanings, and that, in view of their implicit time-dependence, the district court did not err in construing the literal scope of the claim limitations qualified by those terms as being limited to technologies existing at the time of the invention.

PC Connector's argument that the dictionary definitions of "normally," "conventional," "traditionally," and "standard" contain no explicit reference to a time limitation is not persuasive, as their time-related significance is implicit from their ordinary usage-just as other words are implicitly not time-related. A comparison of the words "conventional" and "dedicated" is instructive in this regard, as PC Connector's bricfs appear to treat them as interchangeable and coterminous in claim scope, when, in fact, they are not. To illustrate, a presentday USB port may be described as a "dedicated" I/O port within the ordinary meaning of "dedicated" as that word would be used to characterize the I O ports found on a computer built in 1988, yet it would not be considered "conventional" back then, even though it is "conventional" today. Thus, unlike the word "dedicated," the word "conventional" necessarily has a meaning specific to the time of filing.
406 F.3d at 1363-64. Do these words have "implicit" time-related significance? Why did the patentee invite this discussion by limiting the claim to an adapter for peripherals having "conventional" connectors? For more on this important issue, see Mark A. Lemley, The Changing Meaning of Patent Claim Terms, 104 MiCt. L. Rev. 101 (2005)
(arguing that patent claim terms should have a fixed meaning throughout time, and that that meaning should be fixed at the time the patent application is first filed).
6. Two Standards of Claim Construction. During patent prosecution, the PTO applies "the broadest reasonable interpretation" (BRI) in construing claims, not the normal rules of claim construction just discussed. The rationale for using this standard, as opposed to the meaning that a PHOSITA would give a claim term (as articulated in Phillips), is that it facilitates the exploration of the "metes and bounds to which the applicant may be entitled, and thus to aid in sharpening and clarifying the claims during the application stage, when claims are readily changed." See In re Skvorecz, 580 F.3d 1262, 1267 (Fed. Cir. 2009); U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Manual of Patent Examining Procedure §2111 (9th ed. Mar. 2014). The applicant has wide latitude to amend claims during examination.

The Supreme Court upheld the use of BRI in IPR proceedings as a reasonable exercise of the PTO's rulemaking authority under the AIA. See Cuozzo Speed Techs., LLC, v. Lee, 579 U.S. 261 (2016). The PTO has nonetheless abandoned BRI for IPRs, using the normal rules of claim construction instead.
7. Standard of Appellate Review. One of the most controversial issues bricfed, but not resolved, in Phillips was whether the Federal Circuit should review district court decisions de novo, i.e., without deference to underlying factual findings. Judge Mayer's dissent took the issue up, but did not bring along enough of his colleagues.

The deference issue continued to reverberate in the Federal Circuit after the Phillips decision. Even though the claim construction reversal rate dropped significantly, see J. Jonas Anderson \& Peter S. Menell, Informal Deference: A Historical, Empirical, and Normative Analysis of Patent Claim Construction, 108 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1, 41-42, 48-56 (2014), judges within the circuit remained split on the proper standard of review. The Supreme Court finally resolved the controversy in Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 574 U.S. 318 (2015). The Court held that claim construction can entail fact-finding and restored the fundamental juridical principle-reflected in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(6)-that the Federal Circuit, like other appellate courts, must "give due regard to the trial court's opportunity to judge the witnesses' credibility" and defer to the trial court's factual determinations unless "clearly erroncous." Nonetheless, the Court recognized the primacy of the intrinsic evidence. Thus, while factual determinations underlying claim construction rulings are subject to the "clearly erroneous" (or "abuse of discretion") standard of review, the Federal Circuit exercises de novo review over the ultimate claim construction decision. In this manner, district judges can use their distinctive vantage point and evidentiary tools to ferret out factual underpinnings while the Federal Circuit can operate as a check on fidelity to the patent instrument.

As a practical matter, however, very little has changed since Teva. Courts overwhelmingly focus on intrinsic evidence, following Phillips, and so the Federal Circuit has not had occasion to defer to district court factfinding on claim construction. This may change if district judges begin to hold evidentiary hearings as part of claim construction and make formal factual findings as to the meaning of disputed claim terms. See J. Jonas Anderson \& Peter S. Menell, Restoring the Fact/Law Distinction in Patent Claim Construction, 109 Nw. U. L. Rev. ONLINE 187 (2015).
