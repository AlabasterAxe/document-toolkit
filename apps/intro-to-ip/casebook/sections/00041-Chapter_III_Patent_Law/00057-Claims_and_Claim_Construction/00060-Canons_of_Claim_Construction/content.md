Courts have established a set of rules, or canons, of interpretation to help guide the claim construction process. See generally Peter S. Menell, Matthew D. Powers, \& Steven C. Carlson, Patent Claim Construction: A Modern Synthesis and Structured Framework, 25 BERKELEY TECH. L.J. 711 (2010).

## i. Ordinary vs. Contextual or "Particular" Meaning

Reliance on context is actually a collection of rules and sub-doctrines, rather than a single canon. The general issue is this: claims are skeletal, employing as few words as possible. (Remember that in general the fewer the words, the broader the claim.) Specifications, by contrast, are written to put flesh on these bones-to provide background and depth to explain how an invention works. The goal in drafting a specification is to satisfy the enablement and written description requirements of ยง112-to tell people in the art how to "make and use" the invention. Often a word used in a claim will also be used in the specification-in context. These contrasting uses provide the grist for many a hard-fought contest over claim interpretation.

As a starting point, the Federal Circuit has often stated its presumption that the meaning of words in a claim is the "ordinary," i.e., non-contextual, meaning that would be assigned to those words. Phillips v. AWH Corp. 415 F.3d 1303, 1312-13 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc).

Despite starting with ordinary meaning, most claim interpretation cases turn on contextual (or, as the Phillips court called them, "particular") meanings. The dispute in Nystrom v. TREX Co., Inc., 424 F.3d 1136 (Fed. Cir. 2005), concerned the term "board." Nystrom, the patentee, claimed "[a] board for use in constructing a flooring surface for exterior use. . ." The question was whether "boards" was limited to wooden boards. The accused infringer, TREX, sold exterior decking planks made from composites of wood fibers and recycled plastic. Nystrom argued for the plain or ordinary meaning of "board" and cited various dictionary definitions to prove that the "ordinary" or "plain" meaning of "board" is not limited to a thing made of wood. Nystrom's specification, however, consistently described his decking invention with respect to wooden boards. The court limited Nystrom to the context and background of the specification to flesh out-and hence limit-the meaning of the word in the claim.

## ii. "Lexicographer" Rule

The "ordinary meaning" approach has a further limitation: patentees are free to be their own lexicographers-i.e., to define claim terms in any way they wish. Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc) ("[O]ur cases recognize that the specification may reveal a special definition given to a claim term by the patentee that differs from the meaning it would otherwise possess. In such cases, the inventor's lexicography governs."); Jack Guttman, Inc. v. Kopyhake Enterprises, Inc., 302 F.3d 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (an example of a patentee expressly defining a term).
Jack Gutman Enterprises is a very rare case: the vast majority of cases that cite the "lexicographer rule" do not involve an explicit definition.


1. A solid preparation providing extended release of an active compound with very low solubility in water comprising a solution or dispersion of an effective amount of the active compound in a semi-solid or liquid nonionic solubilizer, wherein the amount by weight of the solubilizer is at least equal to the amount by weight of the active compound, and a release controlling system to provide extended release.
The dispute centered on the term "solubilizer." The Federal Circuit observed that " [t] he parties agree that as a general matter, artisans would understand the term 'solubilizer' to embrace three distinct types of chemicals: (1) surface active agents (also known as "surfactants"), (2) co-solvents, and (3) complexation agents." Id. at 1336 (footnote omitted). The district court, looking to "ordinary meaning," held that "solubilizer" comprised three types of chemicals noted above based on a dictionary definition. The Federal Circuit reversed on the ground that the patentee had specifically "disavowed" the latter two categories of chemicals.
[W]e hold that the inventors deliberately acted as their own lexicographers. The 'Description of the Invention' states that ' [t] he solubilizers suitable according to the invention are defined below' (emphasis added), and two paragraphs later, states that ' [t] he solubilizers suitable for the preparations according to the invention are semi-solid or liquid non-ionic surface active agents' (emphasis added). Astrazeneca maintains that these statements simply refer to preferred embodiments of 'suitable' solubilizers. We might agree if the specification stated, for example, 'a solubilizer suitable for the preparations according to the invention,' but in fact, the specification definitively states 'the solubilizers suitable for the preparations according to the invention' (emphasis added). Astrazeneca seems to suggest that lexicography requires a statement in the form 'I define . . . to mean . . . ,' but such rigid formalism is not required. . . Certainly the ' 081 specification's statement that ' [t] he solubilizers suitable according to the invention are defined below' provides a strong signal of lexicography.
Id. at 1340 .
In an effort to promote claim clarity, the PTO instituted a pilot program to encourage applicants to provide glossaries by offering accelerated examination. The program ended as a result of the relatively low participation. See USPTO, Glossary Initiative, http://www.uspto.gov/patent/initiatives/glossary-initiative.
# iii. Disclaimer of Subject Matter 

Accused infringers often contend that language in a patent's specification forms a special contextual meaning for a word used in a patent claim. At times, "meaning through context" involves the more specific argument that a patentee has affirmatively disclaimed a certain meaning. This can arise through language in the specification or, commonly, statements made during patent prosecution. If successful, this argument establishes that certain interpretations of claim language are foreclosed by the patentee's own explicit statements. AstraZeneca AB, Inc. v. Mutual, 384 F.3d 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2004), is once again instructive:

Second, we hold the specification clearly disavows nonsurfactant solubilizers. The inventors' lexicography alone works an implicit disavowal of nonsurfactant solubilizers, but the rest of the specification goes further. The 'Description of the Invention' twice describes micelle structures as a feature of the novel formulation structure conceived by the inventors. . . It is undisputed that surfactants are the only solubilizers believed to form micelle structures in watery environments. Indeed, immediately after the reference to the 'micellestructure formed by the solubilizer' of the invention, the specification criticizes other types of solubilizers-and specifically co-solvents-as leading to undesirable precipitation. . . . AstraZeneca contends that these statements in the specification simply address the features of preferred embodiments. Astrazeneca seems to suggest that clear disavowal requires an 'expression of manifest exclusion or restriction' in the form of 'my invention does not include . . . .' But again, such rigid formalism is not required: Where the general summary or description of the invention describes a feature of the invention (here, micelles formed by the solubilizer) and criticizes other products (here, other solubilizers, including co-solvents) that lack that same feature, this operates as a clear disavowal of these other products (and processes using these products).
Id. at at 1340 .
The Federal Circuit requires that any such disavowal be "clear and unambiguous" to alter claim scope. See Microsoft Corp. v. Multi-Tech Sys., Inc., 357 F.3d 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2004). It regularly resists efforts to change the ordinary meaning of claim terms through disclaimer, particularly when it is based on the prosecution history rather than the specification. For a debated example, see Astrazeneca AB v. Mylan Pharms., 19 F.4th 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (construing the term " 0.001% " to mean exactly or nearly 0.001%; the ordinary meaning (and the dissent's reading) would include rounding up from 0.0005% and down from 0.0014%, but here the patentee distinguished its invention from one at 0.0005% ).

## iv. "Claim Differentiation": Contextual Meaning from Other Claims

The doctrine of claim differentiation is the patent law version of a general principle of legal interpretation: the non-redundancy principle. See, e.g., Bailey' v. United States, 516 U.S. 137, 146 (1995) ("We assume that Congress used two terms because it intended each term to have a particular, nonsuperfluous meaning."); Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 339 (1979) ("In construing a statute we are obliged to give effect, if possible, to every word Congress used."); Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379, 392 (1979) (explaining that an "elementary canon of construction [is] that a statute should be interpreted so as not to render one part inoperative"). The court relied on the claim differentiation doctrine in Phillips. Do you agree with its analysis?

Recall that the issue in Nystrom was the meaning of the word "board." The accused infringer, TREX, wanted to limit the meaning of the claim to "wooden boards," so as to exclude TREX's composite boards from the definition and therefore from legal liability for infringement. Nystrom argued that the meaning of "board" in claim 1 could not logically be limited to "wooden boards," because claim 16 of the Nystrom patent specifically claimed "a wooden board." Interpreting "board" in claim 1 as implicitly meaning "wooden board" would render meaningless the language of claim 16. If "board" in this patent means "wooden board," claim 16 would mean "wooden wooden board"-a ridiculous proposition. Why might that argument not have prevailed? Cf. Mark A. Lemley, The Limits of Claim Differentiation, 22 Berkeley Tech. L.J. 1389 (2007) (arguing that claim differentiation should be applied with caution because patent drafters are often aiming for redundancy).

# v. Purpose or Goal of the Invention 

One contextual clue that courts have used to supply meaning for a claim term is the purpose or goal of an invention. In Minnesota Mining \& Manufacturing Co. v. Johnson \& Johnson Orthopaedics, Inc., 976 F.2d 1559 (Fed. Cir. 1992), Minnesota Mining held a series of patents related to orthopedic casting tapes and, more specifically, to resinbased casting systems which have replaced the old-fashioned plaster casts. The claimed casts were formed from curable sheets of material. Several key claims required that each sheet have a "lubricant" or be "pre-lubricated." Polyethylene and silicon were identified in the patent as effective lubricants. This posed a problem, given that certain references in the prior art disclosed identical lubricants, but those lubricants were said to be directed to other functions, and when used they resulted in a "tacky" surface that would not serve the purpose of making a smooth orthopedic cast. The Federal Circuit interpreted the claims at issue so as to find no anticipation. The district court had found that the lubricants disclosed in the patent specification were designed to make the sheet's resin slippery when activated. The Federal Circuit held that it was absolutely correct to "use the specification . . . to determine what the inventor meant by terms and phrases in the claims." And, more importantly: "The fundamental purpose and significance of the [patented] invention is to produce a non-sticky or non-tacky resin (i.e., a slippery resin) to permit smoothing and forming of the casting tapes, thereby overcoming the 'tacky resin' problem of the prior art. . . . This is evident throughout the patent specification."

Related to this idea is the canon that a construction that excludes the patentee's preferred embodiment is ordinarily improper. Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic, Inc., 90
F.3d 1576, 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1996) ("Such an interpretation is rarely, if ever, correct and would require highly persuasive evidentiary support.").

# vi. Construing Claims to Preserve Their Validity 

A traditional maxim of claim construction was that claims should be construed, where possible, to preserve their validity. See, e.g., Rhine v. Casio, Inc., 183 F.3d 1342, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 1999) ("claims should be so construed, if possible, as to sustain their validity"). This canon too has its roots in statutory interpretation-the rule that statutes are to be construed where possible to avoid raising constitutional questions. Similarly, courts sought to construe claims to avoid raising questions of validity. Almost always, that maxim counseled in favor of construing those claims narrowly.

Since Markman, however, courts have shied away from applying this doctrine. In part the problem is procedural: a court construing patent claims pretrial cannot know how a jury will rule on the question of validity. Phillips was dismissive of the canon, and it has fallen into general disuse in the wake of that opinion. The courts have warned that this canon is "a last resort, not a first principle." MBO Labs., Inc. v. Becton, Dickinson \& Co., 474 F.3d 1323, 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2007). And in any event, patent claim drafters should not rely on courts to save their patents from inadvertent drafting errors. This was the sad lesson of the drafter in Chef America, Inc. v. Lamb-Weston, Inc., 358 F.3d 1371, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2004), who made the mistake of claiming that its cookie dough product should be baked "to" a temperature of 450-800 degrees Fahrenheit. Although the drafter undoubtedly intended to claim a process of baking that involved heating the oven to this temperature, and then baking for a brief time, the court would not change the clearly stated claim language; so the inventor ended up with a patent that covered only charred hunks of dough.

## vii. A Tiebreaker: Narrow Construction Preferred

Some have suggested, drawing upon the contra proferentem contract law principle, that the claims should be interpreted against the draftsperson, i.e., the patentee. See 3M Innovative Properties Cos. v. Tredegar Corp., 725 F.3d 1315, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2013). Does this analogy make sense? Should it matter whether (as is normally true) the patentee wants the claim construed broadly or whether (as is sometimes the case) it is the accused infringer who wants the broad construction? The final canon of construction may be expressed as a tic-breaker rule: when two interpretations are equally plausible, choose the narrower interpretation. Hence, the rule is to be deployed sparingly, only in cases that remain close after all other interpretive resources have been exhausted. But sometimes after all the rules are applied, two equally plausible interpretations of a claim-one broader, one narrower-are possible. In such a case, the Federal Circuit has held that the "notice function" of claims requires that the narrower interpretation prevail. See Athletic Alternatives, Inc. v. Prince Manufacturing, Inc., 73 F.3d 1573, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1996).

An argument can be made that the contra proferentem rule ought to be applied routinely to encourage more clarity and less opportunism by patent drafters. See Peter S. Menell \& Michael J. Meurer, Notice Failure and Notice Externalities, 5 J. Legal ANALYSIS 1 (2013).

The following chart summarizes the principal claim construction principles and canons:

# FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES 

- Construe from perspective of one of ordinary skill in the art - Construe from time period of invention (i.e., effective filing date)
- Interpret claim terms by reference to patent and prosecution history as a whole - Appropriate to consider extrinsic evidence, but it cannot contradict intrinsic evidence - No "presumption in favor of dictionary definition" - No "heavy presumption" of ordinary meaning ![img-15.jpeg](img-15.jpeg)

FACTORS THAT FAVOR NARROWER CONSTRUCTION DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION - Characterization of "the present invention" - Distinctions over the prior art - Consistent usage of claim terms in patent and prosecution history PROSECUTION DISCLAIMER - Surrendering claim scope during prosecution narrows claim interpretation - "Clear and unmistakable disavowal" required for prosecution disclaimer
## SPECIAL CASES

- Inventors may expressly define terms differently than ordinary meaning - Specification may disclaim coverage to embodiments - Ambiguity in claim term may permit limiting scope to preferred embodiment - Means-plus-function terms are limited to structures in specification, and equivalents PETER S.

# PROBLEMS 

Problem III-12. Pizza King holds U.S. Patent No. 4,498,686 pertaining to a "package saver" invention.

## Abstract

A temperature resistant molded plastic device is described for use in boxes or packages such as pizza boxes where there is a tendency of large cover portions to sag downwardly to damage the soft pizza or other packaged products. In use, the saver is positioned near the center of the package to support the box cover for protecting the contents.

## Background of the Invention

[T]he invention relates to such a package saver which is molded from plastic to have minimal size, weight, and cost and which is suitable for supporting large carton covers such as those used for pizza pies. The molded plastic saver is positioned centrally of the completed pie or other product to support the cover during storage and delivery. ***
[A]n object of the present invention is to provide an easily manufactured, relatively inexpensive, lightweight article which is placed on the pie or cake within the package to support the central portion of the package cover during delivery.
![img-16.jpeg](img-16.jpeg)

## Description of the Preferred Embodiment

To provide a lightweight and inexpensive device for the purpose discussed above, the saver is preferably molded as a unitary device from one of the plastics which is heat resistant such as the thermo set plastics and which will resist temperatures of as high as about 500^F.

In its preferred form, as illustrated, the saver 1 has spaced vertical legs 2 connected to a cover support 3 . The lower portions of the legs 4 have a minimal cross section to minimize any marking of the protected article 5 and they are also made thin for minimizing the volume of plastic required. The cover support 3 of the saver 1 also preferably has a minimum volume by consisting of a spoke-like arrangement of radially oriented leg supports 6 molded to extend from a central portion 7.

This construction of portion support 3 provides a suitable broad and stable support for box 8 cover 9 which is of minimal volume and thus has minimal cost. A disposable saver 1 is provided which may be used in the boxes or cartons without damage to the packaged pizza pie or other product.

As various changes may be made in the form, construction and arrangement of the invention and without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, and without sacrificing any of its advantages, it is to be understood that all matters herein is to be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.

# Claims 

Having thus described my invention, I claim:

1. in combination a package having a flexible cover, a food article packaged therein and spaced downwardly from the cover, a unitary molded plastic package saving device for positioning between the cover and the article for supporting the package cover thereby preventing damage to the packaged food article by the cover, said device comprising the combination of three or more spaced legs, each leg having one relatively flat end adapted for engaging the packaged article and having its opposite end attached to a device cover portion.
2. The combination as claimed in claim 1 in which said device cover portion comprises a number of flat cover sections radiating from a common flat central portion.
3. The combination as claimed in claim 1 wherein said device is formed of heat resistant plastic.
4. The combination as claimed in claim 1 wherein said device is formed of thermosetting plastic.

Giuseppe's Pizza develops its own package saver device by fusing together two plastic pieces.

Pizza King sues for patent infringement. The court schedules a Markman hearing to construe the patent claim. What is Giuseppe's best claim construction? What is Pizza King's best response? On what do you base the argument and counter-argument? If you were the judge, what would you decide?
Problem III-13. Lonnic Jackson operates a hair salon. She has struggled over the years to deal with clogged drains. To keep her plumbing costs under control, Lonnie invented the Hair Hook:
![img-18.jpeg](img-18.jpeg)

It works by threading the elongated end into the clogged drain, fishing for hair, and then removing the device.
![img-19.jpeg](img-19.jpeg)

The Patent Office grants Jackson the following claim:

1. Apparatus for removing hair from a drain, comprising:
(a) an elongate, flexible Strip;
(b) the elongate, flexible Strip having a plurality of barbed portions, the barbed portions being adapted to grip hair in the drain, wherein the barbed portions are oriented at an acute angle to the axis of the elongate Strip, wherein the vertex of the angle points away from the handle; and (c) a handle, wherein the handle is a distinct structural element from the elongate, flexible Strip.
After Drain Declogger (DD) starts selling a product that is identical to the claimed invention, Jackson sues for patent infringement. DD responds that the Hair Hook patent is invalid based on the ' 789 patent (issued more than 20 years ago) which discloses "resilient flat strip of metal capable of being extended and consisting normally of a series of concentric coils, one end of said strip being provided with a sharp spear-point."
![img-20.jpeg](img-20.jpeg)

What claim term(s) require(s) construction in sorting out this invalidity defense? How should a court resolve the claim construction? How should the court resolve the invalidity defense?
