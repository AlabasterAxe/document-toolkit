Patent scope plays a critical role in patent law. Beginning in the middle of the nineteenth century, inventors sought greater breadth in the boundaries of their invention by attempting to define their invention at a higher level of abstraction. Rather than claiming the device they actually built or described, inventors sought to identify the inventive contribution and to claim any device that incorporated that inventive contribution, even if it was not identical to the patentee's device. These patentees were using claim language to define a conceptual area rather than identify specific patent boundaries. See Mark A. Lemley, Software Patents and the Return of Functional Claiming, 2013 Wis. L. Rev. 905. An inventor of a new chemical might, for instance, claim a group of related chemicals-a genus-rather than specify each of the species.

The Wright Brothers, for instance, invented only a particular improvement to flying machines, albeit a critical one: they came up with a way of warping a wing to control the direction of flight while turning a rear rudder to counterbalance the effect of bending the wing, maintaining the stability of the plane. JOHN ANDERSON, JR., InVENTING Flight: The Wright Brothers and Their Predecessors 101 (2004). The Wrights solved the stability problem by having a single cable warp the wing and turn the rudder at the same time. Their patent, however, was written using functional language, claiming "means for simultaneously moving the lateral portions [of a wing] into different angular relations" and "means whereby said rudder is caused to present to the wind that side thereof . . . having the smaller angle of incidence." U.S. Patent No. 821,393 claim 7
(filed Mar. 23, 1903). Glenn Curtiss improved the design of the wing by using ailerons, movable portions of the wing. Ailerons could be moved independently of the rudder by the pilot; the two were not connected, as they were in the Wright's design. But the Wright Brothers nonetheless successfully asserted the patent against subsequent inventors such as Glenn Curtiss. Judge Learned Hand held that the ailerons under separate control were literally within the scope of the patent. Wright Co. v. Paulhan, 177 F. 261, 264 (C.C.S.D.N.Y. 1910) (holding the Wrights' patent to be pioneering and so entitled to broad scope). A frustrated Curtiss was reported to have said that the Wright brothers believed their patent was so broad that anyone who jumped up and down and flapped their arms infringed it. The Wrights successfully enforced their patent to defeat all alternative aircraft, including many that surpassed the technical achievement of the Wrights.

By the 1940s, functional claiming of this sort had become widespread. The Supreme Court rejected the practice in 1946 in Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Co. v. Walker, 329 U.S. 1 (1946); cf. Funk Bros. Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co., 333 U.S. 127, 133 (1948) (Frankfurter, J., concurring) (arguing that claims to groups of bacteria that are "not identified and are identifiable only by their compatibility" should be rejected because similar efforts to claim by function in other areas are impermissible). In Halliburton, the patentee had drafted its claim entirely in functional terms, referring to "means for" performing various functions. The Court held that the patent claim was indefinite because it did not specify how the patent performed the function or limited the invention to the particular means the patentee actually invented. Substituting broad functional language at the very point of novelty, the Court said, did not sufficiently put the world on notice of what the patentee was removing from the world.

Patent lawyers took their case to Congress. When Congress passed the Patent Act of 1952 six years after Halliburton, it overruled Halliburton insofar as that decision had prevented functional claiming at the point of novelty. Patentees could once again use functional language such as "means for processing data" even if the data processing means was the novel part of the invention. Nonetheless, Congress limited the scope of "means-plus-function" claim elements. Section 112(f) provides:

An element in a claim for a combination may be expressed as a means or step for performing a specified function without the recital of structure, material, or acts in support thereof, and such claim shall be construed to cover the corresponding structure, material, or acts described in the specification and equivalents thereof.
This "means-plus-function" claiming represents a significant departure from the normal rules of patent claim construction. Patent claim construction starts with the plain meaning of the claim language. While the description of the invention can be read to help understand what the claims mean, the fundamental rule of patent claim construction is that the claim terms are not to be narrowed by reference to what the patentee actually invented or described. A patentee can, for example, claim a group of chemicals without having described, much less tested, all or even many of the chemicals in the group. Similarly, a patent claim to a "chair comprising a seat, legs, and a back" would cover a nearly infinite array of chairs, regardless of how many legs it has, whether it has wheels on the legs, and whether it is made of wood, metal, plastic, or upholstery. See Jeffrey A. Lefstin, The Formal Structure of Patent Law and the Limits of Enablement, 23 Berkeley Tech. L.J. 1141, 1169-70 (2008). Further, if the patentee uses the magic word "comprising" (and virtually all do) the patent claim must include the listed elements but is not limited to those elements; adding additional elements (such as arms) will not avoid infringement.

Against this backdrop, §112(f) actually represents a significant narrowing of claim scope. While the 1952 Act rejected Halliburton and permitted functional claiming, in fact the sort of functional claiming the statutory text allows is far different from the functional claiming that was the norm in 1940. A means-plus-function claim element is not interpreted to cover every means of performing the function. Instead, the courts apply a different rule of claim construction, limiting the scope of these claims by reading in the particular technologies described in the patent specification.

To take an example, suppose that the patent claim includes as an element a "means for processing data." Read literally, without reference to §112(f), this language would encompass any possible means for processing data, including any computer, but also a calculator, an abacus, pencil and paper, and perhaps even the human brain. Section 112(f) permits the use of such functional language but doesn't permit it to cover any means of performing the data-processing function. Instead, the claim would be limited to the particular "means for processing data" actually described in the patent specification (say, an iPad) "and equivalents thereof."

While the last phrase in the statute-"and equivalents thereof"-permits some broadening of both means-plus-function and step-plus-function claims, such equivalents must have been known as of the time of the invention. (As we will see in (D)(1)(a)(ii), infra, the doctrine of equivalents can provide an additional stretch to "equivalents" based on after-arising advances, i.e., based on technologies that emerge after the time of the invention claimed using functional language.) The first stage in the analysis is whether the term in question is "mean-plus-function." See DePuy Spine, Inc. v. Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Inc., 469 F.3d 1005, 1023 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (Means-plusfunction claiming applies only to "purely functional limitations that do not provide the structure that performs the recited function."). The Federal Circuit applied a rebuttable presumption that §112(f) applies "[i]f the word 'means' appears in a claim element in association with a function." Callicrate v. Wadsworth Mfg., Inc., 427 F.3d 1361, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2005). As illustrated in Phillips, however, the presumption is rebutted where the claim language itself provides the structure that performs the recited function.

This presumption against construing such limitations under §112(f) used to be characterized as a "strong" presumption. See Inventio AG v. ThyssenKrupp Elevator Americas Corp., 649 F.3d 1350, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2011). To rein in vague claims, the Federal Circuit revoked this characterization of the presumption as "strong" in Williamson v. Citrix Online LLC, 792 F.3d 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (en banc): a term lacking "means" will nonetheless be construed under §112(f) if the "challenger demonstrates that the claim fails to recite sufficiently definite structure or else recites function without reciting sufficient structure for performing that function." The focus is on the claim language as a whole, not just the isolated term that is akin to "means." Generic terms such as "mechanism," "clement," "device" and other such terms that do not connote sufficiently definite structure in the context of the overall claim are tantamount to stating "means," and therefore may be construed pursuant to §112(f) if nothing else in the claim provides sufficient structure. The Federal Circuit referred to such "black box" words as "nonce" words. But see Dyfan, LLC v. Target Corp., 28 F.4th 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2022) (concluding that the term "code" provided sufficient structure). The focus should remain on whether the term, in the context of the claim as a whole, connotes a class (even a broad class) of specific structures. If so, then the term should not be construed under §112(f).

Once it is determined that §112(f) applies, then the court proceeds through three steps: (1) identifying the function of the term based upon claim term language (but not embodiments); (2) identifying the corresponding structure, material, or act based on disclosed embodiments; and (3) at the infringement stage, the fact-finder determines whether the accused device falls within "equivalents thereof" as of the time of patent issuance. See Peter S. Menell, et al., Patent Case Management Judicial Guide, §5.2.3.5 (Federal Judicial Center 3rd ed. 2016).

# PROBLEM III-14 

Ernest Kahlert obtained a patent for in-line skates in 1953. His breakthrough related to cushioning the wheels. To avoid cluttering his apparatus claim with detailed explanation of the upper portion of the device, he began his claim as follows: "An inline roller skate, comprising an upper portion adapted to receive the skater's foot, a means for fastening said upper portion . . " His specification notes that " [t] he upper portion of the roller blade can be fastened with laces, zippers, buckles, and snaps."

Unbeknownst to Kahlert, a Swiss electrical engineer George de Mestral had been experimenting with a new method of fastening. While walking in the woods, he wondered if the burrs that clung to his trousers-and dog-could be turned into something useful. This led him to develop a hook and loop fastener, which he patented in 1955. The fastener consisted of two components: a lineal fabric strip with tiny hooks that could "mate" with another fabric strip with smaller loops, attaching temporarily, until pulled apart. The early prototypes were made of cotton, which proved impractical. He eventually landed on the idea of using nylon and polyester, which became a great success. De Mestral gave the name Velcro, combining the French words velours ("velvet"), and crochet ("hook").

In 1958, Rollerglide introduced an inline skate that had all of the elements of Kahlert's claimed invention except that it used a compression strap combined with a buckle as well as Velcro (duly licensed) to fasten the upper portion of the shoe. The compression strap/buckle and Velcro fasteners held the foot snuggly, while providing flexibility. Inline skate enthusiasts loved it and it quickly displaced sales of Kaglert's product. Kahlert seeks your advice on whether Rollerglide's product falls within the scope of Kahlert's claim. Does Rollerglide's product come within Kahlert's claim? Explain how you reached this conclusion.
