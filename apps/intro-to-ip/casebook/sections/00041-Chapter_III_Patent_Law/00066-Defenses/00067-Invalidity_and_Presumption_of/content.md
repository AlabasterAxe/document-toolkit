In a conventional patent enforcement action, where a patent owner seeks to hold an alleged infringer liable, the patent owner does not have to prove the validity of the patent. Under ยง282(a), a patent is presumed valid. We discussed the grounds for invalidity in Chapter III(B). They are the same whether the PTO or the courts are considering validity. Once a patent has issued, though, " [t] he burden of establishing invalidity . . . rest[s] on the party asserting such invalidity." Id. This presumption aims to secure the patentee's quasi-property right and reflects the role of the PTO in examining the application. The party disputing the patent's validity must prove invalidity by "clear and convincing evidence," a higher standard than the typical civil law standard-preponderance of the evidence.

## COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS

1. Should this standard apply where the alleged infringer brings forth prior art that the Patent Office did not consider during examination? The Supreme Court noted in KSR Int'l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 426 (2007) "the rationale underlying the presumption-that the PTO, in its expertise, has approved the claim-seems much diminished." Yet the Court ruled in Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd., 564 U.S. 91 (2011), that the presumption still applies, but "the challenger's burden to persuade the jury of its invalidity defense by clear and convincing evidence may be easier to sustain. . . [T]he jury may be instructed to consider that it has heard evidence that the PTO had no opportunity to evaluate before granting the patent."
2. Assignor Estoppel. Based on norms of equitable dealing and the property doctrine of estoppel by deed-which prohibits a property grantor from challenging the validity of a grant-courts have long barred the assignor of a patent or patent application from attacking the validity of that patent in a subsequent patent infringement litigation absent exceptional circumstances. See Mentor Graphics Corp. v. Quickturn Design Systems, Inc., 150 F.3d 1374, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 1998); Westinghouse Elec. \& Mfg. Co. v. Formica Insulation Co., 266 U.S. 342, 348-49 (1924). The Federal Circuit had interpreted the doctrine broadly to bar inventors who later move to a competing company or start one of their own from challenging patents that they had assigned to a prior employer, even if they did not sell the patent to its current owner but simply signed an employment agreement assigning all rights in their inventions. Scholars have questioned the breadth of this interpretation. See Mark A. Lemley, Rethinking Assignor Estoppel, 54 Hous. L. REV. 513 (2016).

In Minerva Surgical, Inv., v. Hologic, Inc., 594 U.S. 559 (2021), the Supreme Court substantially cabined the assignor estoppel doctrine in holding that there is no unfairness where a patent assignor who has not explicitly or implicitly represented the validity of an assigned patent asserts an invalidity defense. The Court specifically noted that this circumstance arises where: (1) an employee assigns future inventions to an employer as part of a standard invention assignment agreement. patent rights in any future inventions he may develop during his employment; (2) a later legal development renders irrelevant the warranty given at the time of assignment; (3) a post-assignment change in patent claims removes the rationale for applying assignor estoppel; and (4) when an inventor assigns a patent application, rather than an issued patent. In the latter situation, the assignee may return to the PTO to enlarge the patent's claims. Assuming that the new claims are materially broader than the old ones, the assignor did not warrant to the new claims' validity. And if the assignor made no such representation, then assignor estoppel does not prevent the assignor from challenging the new claims in litigation. Absent "an explicit or implicit representation made in assigning patent rights," "an invalidity defense raises no concern of fair dealing-so assignor estoppel has no place." Three dissenters, led by Justice Barrett, would have done away with the doctrine altogether.
3. No Licensee Estoppel. Under traditional contract and property principles, "one receiving bargained-for benefits under a contract may not question the consideration he has received." See Robert B. Orr, Note, The Doctrine of Licensee Repudiation in Patent Law, 63 Yale L.J. 125 (1953). Courts have applied this doctrine to bar patent licensees from challenging the validity of the patents supporting their bargain since the mid-19 ^th century. See Automatic Radio Manufacturing Co. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 339 U.S. 827, 836 (1950). In a break from this tradition, the Supreme Court ruled in Lear, Inc. v. Adkins, 395 U.S. 653 (1969) looked to "the strong federal policy favoring free competition in ideas which do not merit patent protection" reflected in these cases in refusing to honor contractual restrictions on licensees challenging patent validity. The Court emphasized Licensees may often be the only individuals with enough economic incentive to challenge the patentability of an inventor's discovery. If they are muzzled, the public may continually be required to pay tribute to would-be monopolists without need or justification. We think it plain that the technical requirements of contract doctrine must give way before the demands of the public interest in the typical situation involving the negotiation of a license after a patent has issued.
Id. at 670-71. Can you think of any circumstances in which it might be economically efficient to allow parties to restrict licensee patent challenges? If licensees are free to challenge patents for public policy reasons, why not inventors?
