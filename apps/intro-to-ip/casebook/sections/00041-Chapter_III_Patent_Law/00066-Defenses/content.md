Section 282(b) of the Patent Act provides for the following defenses:
(1) Noninfringement, absence of liability for infringement or unenforceability;
(2) Invalidity of the patent or any claim in suit on any ground specified in part II [of the Patent Act] as a condition for patentability;
(3) Invalidity of the patent or any claim in suit for failure to comply with(A) any requirement of section 112, except that the failure to disclose the best mode shall not be a basis on which any claim of a patent may be canceled or held invalid or otherwise unenforceable; or (B) any requirement of section 251 [relating to reissue of defective patents];
(4) Any other fact or act made a defense by [the Patent Act].

In addition to these statutory defenses, courts have recognized a variety of other defenses, including experimental use, inequitable conduct, patent misuse, and equitable estoppel.
