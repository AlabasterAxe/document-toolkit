The practice of "submarine patenting"-deliberately keeping a secret patent application pending for years in the PTO, only to spring it on an unsuspecting industryhas periodically been challenged under a variety of patent law doctrines. Submarine patenting has survived charges of inequitable conduct in some notable district court cases. See Ford Motor Co. v. Lemelson, 42 U.S.P.Q.2d 1706 (D. Nev. 1997); Advanced Cardiovascular Sys. v. Medtronic Inc., 1996 WL 467293 (N.D. Cal. 1996) (both rejecting inequitable conduct claims). But one court has held that allegations of submarine patenting may state an antitrust claim against the patentee. See Discussion Assocs. v. Disc Mfg. Inc., 42 U.S.P.Q.2d 1749 (D. Del. 1997).

In Symbol Technologies v. Lemelson, 277 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2002), the Federal Circuit adopted a theory of "prosecution laches" under which excessive delay in prosecuting a patent could preclude its enforcement against an unsuspecting industry. Symbol Technologies involved notorious submarine patentee Jerome Lemelson, who had amassed well over 1,000 paper patents and had kept some applications pending for over 40 years. The Federal Circuit concluded that unreasonable and unexplained delay in prosecuting a patent could be grounds to bar enforcement of that patent. For subsequent opinions after remand, see 301 F.Supp.2d 1147 (D. Nev. 2004), aff'd, 422 F.3d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2005). Judge Newman, dissenting in the original opinion, argued that because Lemelson had followed the rules for filing continuation applications set out in the patent statute, he should not be barred from enforcing his long-pending patents. See also In re Bogese, 303 F.3d 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (upholding examiner's final rejection of patent due to applicant's unreasonable delay). On the problem of successive continuations in patent applications, see Mark A. Lemley \& Kimberly Moore, Ending Abuse of Patent Continuations, 84 B.U. L. REV. 63 (2004).

Does Symbol Technologies solve the problem of submarine patents by effectively discouraging strategic refiling? Would a bright-line rule serve this purpose better than a reasonableness standard? How can the courts distinguish between delay caused by the patentee and delay that is the fault of the PTO? See Hyatt v. Hirshfeld, 998 F.3d 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (applying prosecution laches against inventor who filed 115,000 claims and kept them pending for 25 years because the inventor caused significant delay, even if the PTO was partially responsible for that delay); Personalized Media Comm'ns., LLC v. Apple Inc., 57 F.4th 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (applying doctrine to patentee who kept applications pending for nearly thirty years and expanded its draft claims from one to 20,000 ).
