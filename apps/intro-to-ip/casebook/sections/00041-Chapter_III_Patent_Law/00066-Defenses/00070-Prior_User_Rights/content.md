Congress established the ยง273 prior user defense as a safe harbor for the financial community in 1999 following State St. Bank v. Signature Fin. Grp., 149 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1998), the controversial decision opening the way for business method patents. Congress expanded the prior user defense significantly in the AIA to include "subject matter consisting of a process, or consisting of a machine, manufacture, or composition of matter used in a manufacturing or other commercial process." ยง273(a). One who secures a prior user right does not invalidate the patent at issue; the right is a personal defense that shields only this one party from liability. For this defense to apply, the invention must have been used commercially in the U.S. by the party asserting the defense at least one year before the earlier of either: (1) the effective filing date, or (2) the date of the first public disclosure of the claimed invention. The prior use defense must be established by clear and convincing evidence. This defense is subject to various limitations and exceptions, including that it may not be asserted against "an institution of higher education . . . or technology transfer organization whose primary purpose is to facilitate the commercialization of technologies developed by one or more such institutions of higher education." ยง273(c)(5). It is also restricted to continued use at the same plant or facility, significantly limiting the growth of the prior user.
