To obtain international protection for patented technology, lawyers and businesspeople must ultimately rely on the domestic patent law of each country. In two respects, however, international treatics do come into play. First, a number of international conventions streamline the procedures under which patents originating outside the host country are prosecuted. Second, certain international treatics provide a uniform substantive floor of protection, a minimum set of rights below which treaty signatories must not fall in conferring patents. Chicf among these is the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPs) Agreement, part of the 1994 Uruguay Round of GATT revisions, which are discussed later in this section.
