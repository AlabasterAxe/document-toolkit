Direct infringement can occur literally-where a person squarely carries out all of the elements of the claimed invention-as well as non-literally.

## i. Literal Infringement

Section 271(a) provides that "whoever without authority makes, uses, offers to sell, or sells any patented invention, within the United States or imports into the United States any patented invention during the term of the patent therefor, infringes the patent." To prove literal infringement, the patent owner must prove that the alleged infringer carries out all of the elements of the claimed invention. This is essentially the mirror image of novelty analysis. If what comes before the patent filing would anticipate the patent claim, it infringes the claim if it comes after the invention date. The analysis often boils down to a dispute over claim interpretation.

## Larami Corp. v. Amron <br> United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania 27 U.S.P.Q.2d 1280 (E.D. Pa. 1993)

REED, J.
This is a patent case concerning toy water guns manufactured by plaintiff Larami Corporation ("Larami"). [The patent claim by defendant appears to have grown out of a counterclaim to plaintiff's action for various Lanham Act and state law violations, predicated on threats made by defendants to various of plaintiff's customers and business associates.] Currently before me is Larami's motion for partial summary judgment of noninfringement of [defendant's] United States Patent No. 4,239,129 ("the '129 patent"). . .

For the reasons discussed below, the motion will be granted.

## I. Background

Larami manufactures a line of toy water guns called "SUPER SOAKERS." This line includes five models: SUPER SOAKER 20, SUPER SOAKER 30, SUPER SOAKER 50, SUPER SOAKER 100, and SUPER SOAKER 200. All use a handoperated air pump to pressurize water and a "pinch trigger" valve mechanism for controlling the ejection of the pressurized water. All feature detachable water reservoirs prominently situated outside and above the barrel of the gun. . . .

Defendants Alan Amron and Talk To Me Products, Inc. (hereinafter referred to collectively as "TTMP") claim that the SUPER SOAKER guns infringe on the ' 129 patent which TTMP obtained by assignment from Gary Esposito ("Esposito"), the inventor. The ' 129 patent covers a water gun which, like the SUPER SOAKERS, operates by pressurizing water housed in a tank with an air pump. In the ' 129 patent, the pressure enables the water to travel out of the tank through a trigger-operated valve into an outlet tube and to squirt through a nozzle. Unlike the SUPER SOAKERS, the ' 129 patent also contains various electrical features to illuminate the water stream and create noises. Also, the water tank in the ' 129 patent is not detachable, but is contained within a housing in the body of the water gun.

The "Background of the Invention" contained in the ' 129 patent reads as follows:
Children of all ages, especially boys, through the years have exhibited a fascination for water, lights and noise and the subject invention deals with these factors embodied in a toy simulating a pistol.
An appreciable number of U.S. patents have been issued which are directed to water pistols but none appear to disclose a unique assembly of components which can be utilized to simultaneously produce a jet or stream of water, means for illuminating the stream and a noise, or if so desired, one which can be operated without employing the noise and stream illuminating means. A reciprocal pump is employed to obtain sufficient pressure whereby the pistol can eject a stream an appreciable distance in the neighborhood of thirty feet and this stream can be illuminated to more or less simulate a lazer [sic] beam. . . .

Larami has moved for partial summary judgment of noninfringement of the ' 129 patent. . . .

# II. Discussion 

## B. Infringement and Claim Interpretation

A patent owner's right to exclude others from making, using or selling the patented invention is defined and limited by the language in that patent's claims. Corning Glass Works v. Sumitomo Electric U.S.A., Inc., 868 F.2d 1251, 1257 (Fed. Cir. 1989). Thus, establishing infringement requires the interpretation of the "elements" or "limitations" of the claim and a comparison of the accused product with those elements as so interpreted. Because claim interpretation is a question of law, it is amenable to summary judgment.

The words in a claim should be given their "ordinary or accustomed" meaning. Sermed, Inc. v. Richard-Allan Medical Industries, Inc., 888 F.2d 815, 819 \& n. 8 (Fed. Cir. 1989). An inventor's interpretations of words in a claim that are proffered after the patent has issued for purposes of litigation are given no weight. . . .
A patent holder can seek to establish patent infringement in either of two ways: by demonstrating that every element of a claim (1) is literally infringed or (2) is infringed under the doctrine of equivalents. To put it a different way, because every element of a claim is essential and material to that claim, a patent owner must, to meet the burden of establishing infringement, "show the presence of every element or its substantial equivalent in the accused device." If even one element of a patent's claim is missing from the accused product, then " [t] here can be no infringement as a matter of law." . . . London v. Carson Pirie Scott \& Co., 946 F.2d 1534, 1538-39 (Fed. Cir. 1991).

Larami contends, and TTMP does not dispute, that twenty-eight (28) of the thirtyfive (35) claims in the ' 129 patent are directed to the electrical components that create the light and noise. Larami's SUPER SOAKER water guns have no light or noise components. Larami also contends, again with no rebuttal from TTMP, that claim 28 relates to a "poppet valve" mechanism for controlling the flow of water that is entirely different from Larami's "pinch trigger" mechanism. Thus, according to Larami, the six remaining claims (claims 1,5,10,11,12 and 16) are the only ones in dispute. Larami admits that these six claims address the one thing that the SUPER SOAKERS and the ' 129 patent have in common-the use of air pressure created by a hand pump to dispense liquid. Larami argues, however, that the SUPER SOAKERS and the ' 129 patent go about this task in such fundamentally different ways that no claim of patent infringement is sustainable as a matter of law.

# 1. Literal Infringement of Claim 1 

TTMP claims that SUPER SOAKER 20 literally infringes claim 1 of the ' 129 patent. Claim 1 describes the water gun as:
[a] toy comprising an elongated housing [case] having a chamber therein for a liquid [tank], a pump including a piston having an exposed rod [piston rod] and extending rearwardly of said toy facilitating manual operation for building up an appreciable amount of pressure in said chamber for ejecting a stream of liquid therefrom an appreciable distance substantially forwardly of said toy, and means for controlling the ejection.

# Patent drawing showing the preferred embodiment of TTMP's water pistol and/or flashlight structure. (Figure 5 in the '129 patent) 

Claim 1 requires, among other things, that the toy gun have "an elongated housing having a chamber therein for a liquid." The SUPER SOAKER 20 water gun, in contrast, has an external water reservoir (chamber) that is detachable from the gun housing, and not contained within the housing. TTMP argues that SUPER SOAKER 20 contains a "chamber therein for a liquid" as well as a detachable water reservoir. It is difficult to discern from TTMP's memorandum of law exactly where it contends the "chamber therein" is located in SUPER SOAKER 20. Furthermore, after having examined SUPER SOAKER 20. . ., I find that it is plain that there is no "chamber" for liquid contained within the housing of the water gun. The only element of SUPER SOAKER 20 which could be described as a "chamber" for liquid is the external water reservoir located atop the housing. Indeed, liquid is located within the housing only when the trigger causes the liquid to pass from the external water reservoir through the tubing in the housing and out of the nozzle at the front end of the barrel. SUPER SOAKER 20 itself shows that such a transitory avenue for the release of liquid is clearly not a "chamber therein for liquid." Therefore, because the absence of even one element of a patent's claim from the accused product means there can be no finding of literal infringement. London. 946 F.2d at 1538-39, I find that SUPER SOAKER 20 does not infringe claim 1 of the ' 129 patent as a matter of law. . . .

Accordingly, I conclude that the SUPER SOAKER 20 water gun does not literally infringe claim 1 of the ' 129 patent.

## 2. Infringement by Equivalents of Claim 10

[The court further found that defendants TTMP failed to produce evidence which would support a finding that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Super Soaker guns infringed claim 10 under the doctrine of equivalents. The court began its analysis by noting that successful use of the doctrine to show infringement requires the patent owner to prove that the accused product has the "substantial equivalent" of every limitation or element of a patent claim. Additionally, Super Soaker's use of an external, detachable water reservoir was found to be such a dramatic improvement over the traditional design-benefiting both the manufacturer and user-that it could not be held to be the "substantial equivalent" of the claim 10 requirement of "a tank in the barrel for a liquid."]

# III. Conclusion 

In patent cases, summary judgment is appropriate where the accused product does not literally infringe the patent and where the patent owner does not muster evidence that is "sufficient to satisfy the legal standard for infringement under the doctrine of equivalents." London, 946 F.2d at 1538. Thus, and for the foregoing reasons, Larami's motion for partial summary judgment of noninfringement of the ' 129 patent will be granted.

## COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS

1. Suppose TTMP had drafted claim 1 using the following phrase: "an elongated housing having a chamber for a liquid." If the specification failed to attach any special meaning to this term, would the court's holding regarding literal infringement of claim 1 have been affected?
2. As in Comment 1, assume that the specification did not discuss further the phrase "having a chamber for a liquid." But suppose that Larami discovers that claim 1 was originally rejected by an examiner because a prior art reference showed a squirt gun with an oversized chamber on top of the body of the gun. The patent applicant successfully overcame this rejection by pointing out that in the invention the chamber is inside the housing of the gun. The face of the ' 129 patent would not, however, give a clue to potential infringers such as Larami as to the potentially narrower definition of the claim language conceded during the prosecution history. To find out what the inventor argued during prosecution, one would need to obtain the prosecution history for the patent.
3. The elements of a patent claim are of considerable importance in determining its scope. For an accused product to literally infringe a patent, every element contained in the patent claim must also be present in the accused product or device. If a claimed apparatus has five parts, or "elements," and the allegedly infringing apparatus has only four of those five, it does not literally infringe. This is true even though the defendant may have copied the four elements exactly, and regardless of how significant or insignificant the missing element is.

What happens if an alleged infringer adds elements? The outcome then depends on the wording of the patentee's claim. If the patentee has drafted an "open" claim, usually indicated by the term "comprising," the additional elements do not circumvent the claim. See, e.g., Genentech, Inc. v. Chiron Corp., 112 F.3d 495, 501 (Fed. Cir. 1997) ("'Comprising' is a term of art used in claim language which means that the named elements are essential, but other elements may be added and still form a construct within the scope of the claim."). But if the claim stated "consisting of," then the alleged infringer would not literally infringe. See Norian Corp. v. Stryker Corp., 363 F.3d 1321 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (claims to dental repair kit "consisting of" certain chemicals not infringed by infringer's kit, which also included mixing spatula).
This rule has an important consequence for the process of innovation. Patentees who have properly claimed a fundamental technology can assert their patent against anyone who uses that technology, even if the defendants have improved it or put it to different use. A broad basic patent therefore gives its owner a great deal of control not only over potential direct competitors, but over a number of derivative or ancillary markets during the term of the patent.

# ii. Infringement Under the Doctrine of Equivalents 

If competitors could circumvent patents through insubstantial changes in the design of a product, then many patents would lose their value, and patent drafters would expend unreasonable efforts trying to include every possible variation. Patent claims are supposed to describe the "metes and bounds" of the invention, just as deeds do for real property. But unlike geophysical measurement, the English language lacks numerical precision. The doctrine of equivalents exists to prevent defendants from taking the essence of the patented invention while skirting the literal language of the claims.

## Graver Tank \& Mfg. Co. v. Linde Air Products Co. Supreme Court of the United States 339 U.S. 605 (1950)

Mr. JUSTICE JACKSON delivered the opinion of the Court.
Linde Air Products Co., owner of the Jones patent for an electric welding process and for fluxes to be used therewith, brought an action for infringement against Lincoln and the two Graver companies. . . .

In determining whether an accused device or composition infringes a valid patent. resort must be had in the first instance to the words of the claim. If accused matter falls clearly within the claim, infringement is made out and that is the end of it.

But courts have also recognized that to permit imitation of a patented invention which does not copy every literal detail would be to convert the protection of the patent grant into a hollow and useless thing. Such a limitation would leave room for-indeed encourage-the unscrupulous copyist to make unimportant and insubstantial changes and substitutions in the patent which, though adding nothing, would be enough to take the copied matter outside the claim, and hence outside the reach of law. One who seeks to pirate an invention, like one who seeks to pirate a copyrighted book or play, may be expected to introduce minor variations to conceal and shelter the piracy. Outright and forthright duplication is a dull and very rare type of infringement. To prohibit no other would place the inventor at the mercy of verbalism and would be subordinating substance to form. It would deprive him of the benefit of his invention and would foster concealment rather than disclosure of inventions, which is one of the primary purposes of the patent system.

The doctrine of equivalents evolved in response to this experience. The essence of the doctrine is that one may not practice a fraud on a patent. Originating almost a century ago in the case of Winans v. Denmead, 15 How. 330 [(1853)], it has been consistently applied by this Court and the lower federal courts, and continues today ready and available for utilization when the proper circumstances for its application arise. "To temper unsparing logic and prevent an infringer from stealing the benefit of the invention" a patentee may invoke this doctrine to proceed against the producer of a device "if it performs substantially the same function in substantially the same way to obtain the same result." Sanitary Refrigerator Co. v. Winters, 280 U.S. 30, 42 [(1929)]. The theory on which it is founded is that "if two devices do the same work in substantially the same way, and accomplish substantially the same result, they are the same, even though they differ in name, form or shape." Union Paper-Bag Machine Co. v. Murphy, 97 U.S. 120, 125 [(1877)]. The doctrine operates not only in favor of the patentee of a pioneer or primary invention, but also for the patentee of a secondary invention consisting of a combination of old ingredients which produce new and useful results, although the area of equivalence may vary under the circumstances. The wholesome realism of this doctrine is not always applied in favor of a patentee but is sometimes used against him. Thus, where a device is so far changed in principle from a patented article that it performs the same or a similar function in a substantially different way, but nevertheless falls within the literal words of the claim, the doctrine of equivalents may be used to restrict the claim and defeat the patentee's action for infringement. Westinghouse v. Boyden Power Brake Co., 170 U.S. 537, 568 [(1898)]. . . .

What constitutes equivalency must be determined against the context of the patent, the prior art, and the particular circumstances of the case. Equivalence, in the patent law, is not the prisoner of a formula and is not an absolute to be considered in a vacuum. It does not require complete identity for every purpose and in every respect. In determining equivalents, things equal to the same thing may not be equal to each other and, by the same token, things for most purposes different may sometimes be equivalents. Consideration must be given to the purpose for which an ingredient is used in a patent, the qualities it has when combined with the other ingredients, and the function which it is intended to perform. An important factor is whether persons reasonably skilled in the art would have known of the interchangeability of an ingredient not contained in the patent with one that was. . . .

In the case before us, we have two electric welding compositions or fluxes: the patented composition, Unionmelt Grade 20, and the accused composition, Lincolnweld 660. The patent under which Unionmelt is made claims essentially a combination of alkaline earth metal silicate and calcium fluoride; Unionmelt actually contains, however, silicates of calcium and magnesium, two alkaline earth metal silicates. Lincolnweld's composition is similar to Unionmelt's, except that it substitutes silicates of calcium and manganese-the latter not an alkaline earth metal-for silicates of calcium and magnesium. In all other respects, the two compositions are alike. The mechanical methods in which these compositions are employed are similar. They are identical in operation and produce the same kind and quality of weld.

The question which thus emerges is whether the substitution of the manganese which is not an alkaline earth metal for the magnesium which is, under the circumstances of this case, and in view of the technology and the prior art, is a change of such substance as to make the doctrine of equivalents inapplicable; or conversely, whether under the circumstances the change was so insubstantial that the trial court's invocation of the doctrine of equivalents was justified.

Without attempting to be all-inclusive, we note the following evidence in the record: Chemists familiar with the two fluxes testified that manganese and magnesium were similar in many of their reactions. There is testimony by a metallurgist that alkaline earth metals are often found in manganese ores in their natural state and that they serve the same purpose in the fluxes; and a chemist testified that "in the sense of the patent" manganese could be included as an alkaline earth metal. Much of this testimony was corroborated by reference to recognized texts on inorganic chemistry. Particularly important, in addition, were the disclosures of the prior art, also contained in the record. The Miller patent, No. 1,754,566, which preceded the patent in suit, taught the use of manganese silicate in welding fluxes. Manganese was similarly disclosed in the Armor patent, No. 1,467,825, which also described a welding composition. And the record contains no evidence of any kind to show that Lincolnweld was developed as the result of independent research or experiments.

It is not for this Court to even essay an independent evaluation of this evidence. This is the function of the trial court. . . .

The trial judge found on the evidence before him that the Lincolnweld flux and the composition of the patent in suit are substantially identical in operation and in result. He found also that Lincolnweld is in all respects equivalent to Unionmelt for welding purposes. And he concluded that "for all practical purposes, manganese silicate can be efficiently and effectively substituted for calcium and magnesium silicates as the major constituent of the welding composition." These conclusions are adequately supported by the record; certainly they are not clearly erroneous.

It is difficult to conceive of a case more appropriate for application of the doctrine of equivalents. The disclosures of the prior art made clear that manganese silicate was a useful ingredient in welding compositions. Specialists familiar with the problems of welding compositions understood that manganese was equivalent to and could be substituted for magnesium in the composition of the patented flux and their observations were confirmed by the literature of chemistry. Without some explanation or indication that Lincolnweld was developed by independent research, the trial court could properly infer that the accused flux is the result of imitation rather than experimentation or invention. Though infringement was not literal, the changes which avoid literal infringement are colorable only. We conclude that the trial court's judgment of infringement respecting the four flux claims was proper, and we adhere to our prior decision on this aspect of the case.

Affirmed.
Mr. Justice Black, with whom Mr. Justice Douglas concurs, dissenting.
I heartily agree with the Court that "fraud" is bad, "piracy" is evil, and "stealing" is reprehensible. But in this case, where petitioners are not charged with any such malevolence, these lofty principles do not justify the Court's sterilization of Acts of Congress and prior decisions, none of which are even mentioned in today's opinion. . . .
[The Patent Act] provides that an applicant "shall particularly point out and distinctly claim the part, improvement, or combination which he claims as his invention or discovery." . . "[I]t is the claim which measures the grant to the patentee." What is not specifically claimed is dedicated to the public. See, e.g., Miller v. Brass Co., 104 U.S. 350,352 [(1881)]. . . Today the Court tacitly rejects those cases. It departs from the underlying principle which, as the Court pointed out in White v. Dunbar, 119 U.S. 47, 51 [(1886)], forbids treating a patent claim "like a nose of wax, which may be turned and twisted in any direction, by merely referring to the specification, so as to make it include something more than, or something different from, what its words express." ... Giving this patentee the benefit of a grant that it did not precisely claim is no less "unjust to the public" and no less an evasion of [the Patent Act] merely because done in the name of the "doctrine of equivalents."

In seeking to justify its emasculation of [the Patent Act] by parading potential hardships which literal enforcement might conceivably impose on patentees who had for some reason failed to claim complete protection for their discoveries, the Court fails even to mention the program for alleviation of such hardships which Congress itself has provided [for reissue of patents due to certain errors arising from "inadvertence, accident, or mistake" of the patentee.]...

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting.
The Court applies the doctrine of equivalents in a way which subverts the constitutional and statutory scheme for the grant and use of patents.

The claims of the patent are limited to a flux "containing a major proportion of alkaline earth metal silicate." Manganese silicate, the flux which is held to infringe, is not an alkaline earth metal silicate. It was disclosed in the application and then excluded from the claims. It therefore became public property. See Mahn v. Harwood, 112 U.S. 354, 361 [(1884)]. It was, to be sure, mentioned in the specifications. But the measure of the grant is to be found in the claims, not in the specifications. The specifications can be used to limit but never to expand the claim.

The Court now allows the doctrine of equivalents to erase those time-honored rules. Moreover, a doctrine which is said to protect against practicing "a fraud on a patent" is used to extend a patent to a composition which could not be patented. For manganese silicate had been covered by prior patents, now expired. Thus we end with a strange anomaly: a monopoly is obtained on an unpatented and unpatentable article.

# COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS 

1. Fair Reward vs. Public Notice. Justice Black complains that the DOE undermines the disclosure requirement. He notes that the patentee could have sought re-issuance of the patent to expand coverage, but broadening reissues may only be obtained within two years of patent issuance. See §251 (d). Who should bear the risk of failing to do so-the patentee or the public? Do you read the dissents to be questioning the DOE or just the majority's application of the DOE to this case?
2. Subject Matter Disclosed but Not Claimed/Dedication to the Public. Justice Douglas rebukes the majority for overriding a venerable doctrine that bars reclaiming of knowledge that has fallen into the public domain. He notes that the patentee disclosed both magnesium and manganese silicates in its specification, yet only claimed magnesium silicates were claimed. (He also notes manganese silicates were in the prior art.) Do you find his criticism persuasive?

The Federal Circuit revisited this question in Johnson \& Johnston Associates Inc. v. R.E. Service Co., Inc., 285 F.3d 1046 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (en banc) and sided with Justice Douglas. The court squarely held that the DOE cannot be used to reach subject matter that was disclosed but not claimed. The only option for the patentee is to reclaim that matter through reissuance of the patent within two years of the patent's issuance. The Federal Circuit emphasized the importance of public notice.
3. Prior Art Rule. A patentee may not use the doctrine of equivalents to obtain coverage of subject matter in the prior art, i.e., "coverage which he could not lawfully have obtained from the USPTO by literal claims." Wilson Sporting Goods Co. v. David Geoffrey \& Assocs., 904 F.2d 677, 683-84 (Fed. Cir. 1990). Accordingly, an accused infringer who merely practices the prior art cannot infringe under the doctrine of equivalents. This principle is applied by constructing a hypothetical claim based on the accused technology. If the PTO could have allowed the hypothetical claim over the prior art (i.e., if the prior art did not anticipate or render the hypothetical claim obvious, Abbott Labs v. Dey, L.P., 287 F.3d 1097, 1105-06 (Fed. Cir. 2002)), the prior art does not preclude infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.
4. All-Elements Rule. In Warner-Jenkinson v. Hilton Davis Chemical Co., 520 U.S. 17 (1997), the Supreme Court revisited the doctrine of equivalents for the first time since Graver Tank. Warner-Jenkinson involved a claim to a process for purifying dyes. The claim had three key limitations: (1) the pore diameter of the filtration screen; (2) a pressure range under which the filtration took place; and (3) a requirement that the filtration take place in an aqueous solution having a pH range "from approximately 6.0 to 9.0 ." Limitation (3), the pH range, was added by the patentee during the prosecution of the patent. The accused infringer, Warner-Jenkinson, used a filtration process that met the first two limitations, but operated at a pH of 5.0 .

The Supreme Court first affirmed the continued viability of the doctrine of equivalents, as it had in Graver Tank. Next, it laid down some basic principles regarding the doctrine. The Court did not reject the venerable "triple identity" test of Graver Tank-i.e., that equivalence may be found where the accused product performs substantially the same function, in substantially the same way, to achieve substantially the same result as the device of the patent claim. But it noted that this test might be more suitable to mechanical inventions than to chemical processes such as the one in this case. On the ultimate question of the proper standard in a doctrine of equivalents case, the Court held:

In our view, the particular linguistic framework used is less important than whether the test is probative of the essential inquiry: Does the accused product or process contain elements identical or equivalent to each claimed element of the patented invention? Different linguistic frameworks may be more suitable to different cases, depending on their particular facts. A focus on individual elements and a special vigilance against allowing the concept of equivalence to eliminate completely any such elements should reduce considerably the imprecision of whatever language is used. An analysis of the role played by each element in the context of the specific patent claim will thus inform the inquiry as to whether a substitute element matches the function, way, and result of the claimed element, or whether the substitute element plays a role substantially different from the claimed element.
520 U.S. at 40 . This approach is known as the "all elements rule." A corollary of the rule states that an accused device cannot be infringing if it would effectively vitiate (or eliminate) any claim limitation. See Freedman Seating Co. v. Am. Seating Co., 420 F.3d 1350, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2005).
5. Prosecution History Estoppel. Another central issue in Warner-Jenkinson was the addition of the pH limit to the claim during prosecution of the patent. This triggered application of the doctrine of "prosecution history estoppel." The accused infringer argued that that doctrine prevented the patentee from arguing infringement under the doctrine of equivalents because the patentee had surrendered coverage for any pH under 6.0 when the " 6.0 to 9.0 " range was added to the claim during prosecution. The Court in Warner-Jenkinson created a presumption under these circumstances that the claim had been amended to avoid prior art, and thus that prosecution history estoppel did indeed apply. 520 U.S. at 33 . But it permitted the patentee to rebut this presumption with evidence that the claim had been amended for some other purpose, unrelated to avoiding the prior art. The status of this presumption, and the doctrine of prosecution history estoppel generally, was the key issue in Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co., Ltd., 535 U.S. 722 (2002).

Recognizing both the difficulties faced by patentees of anticipating unimportant and insubstantial substitutes for elements of their invention as well as the need for clear public notice, the Supreme Court adopted a rebuttable presumption that amendments made to narrow a claim limitation foreclose later stretching of that limitation to reach an accused technology under the doctrine of equivalents. The patentee can rebut this presumption under three scenarios: (1) the equivalent was unforeseeable to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the amendment; (2) the rationale for the amendment was no more than tangentially related to the equivalent at issue; or (3) another reason suggesting that the patentee could not reasonably be expected to have described the alleged equivalent.

If the Court sought to encourage public notice optimally, why not limit the DOE to unforeseeable equivalents-i.e., after-arising technology? Isn't the patentee the least-cost-avoider? Isn't such a foresecability rule consistent with the contra proferentem (interpret against the draftsperson) doctrine?
6. §112(f) Equivalents and the Doctrine of Equivalents: After-Arising Technology. Recall in Problem III-14 (in-line skates) and the Rollerglide's use of Velcro to secure the shoe portion of its in-line skate. As that problem explained, Velcro was not invented until after the patentee's in-line skate invention. Therefore, the use of Velcro as a fastening method could not be equivalent to the corresponding structure, material, or acts described in the specification as of time of the in-line skate invention. But could it be equivalent under the DOE? Can a means-plus-function claim that is not literally infringed be infringed under the doctrine of equivalents?

The cases say yes, but only in two limited circumstances. Specifically, the Federal Circuit has found separate ground for the doctrine of equivalents in §112(f) cases where the function (as opposed to the corresponding structure) was equivalent but not identical, and where the accused device contained after-arising technology that was equivalent to the patented structure, but was not known at the time the patent application was filed. See WMS Gaming, Inc. v. International Game Technology, 184 F.3d 1339 (Fed. Cir. 1999).
7. Reverse Doctrine of Equivalents. The majority in Graver Tank notes that the DOE also works in reverse: "where a device is so far changed in principle from a patented article that it performs the same or a similar function in a substantially different way, but nevertheless falls within the literal words of the claim, the doctrine of equivalents may be used to restrict the claim and defeat the patentee's action for infringement." The Court cites Westinghouse v. Boyden Power Brake Co., 170 U.S. 537, 568 (1898) which has never been overruled, but largely stands alone as a case of literal infringement for which liability did not attach.

The case traces back to a time when trains were the most important overland transportation system. In 1869, George Westinghouse invented a train brake that used a central reservoir of compressed air for stopping power. Further advances in his design, primarily the addition of an air reservoir in each brake cylinder, resulted in a brake that was patented in 1887. An improvement on this 1887 brake, invented by George Boyden, added an ingenious mechanism for pushing compressed air into the brake piston both from the central reservoir and from a local reservoir in each brake cylinder. (Westinghouse's brake required a complicated series of passageways to supply air from the two sources.) With the added stopping power of the Boyden brake, engineers could safely operate the increasingly long trains of the late nineteenth century.

The Westinghouse patent included a claim for "the combination of a main air-pipe, an auxiliary reservoir, a brake-cylinder, a triple valve [the device that coordinated the airflows from the main reservoir and the individual brake reservoir] and an auxiliaryvalve device, actuated by the piston of the triple-valve ... for admitting air in the application of the brake." The Court noted that the literal wording of the Westinghouse patent could be read to cover Boyden's brake, since it included what could be described as a "triple valve." But it refused to find infringement, on the ground that Boyden's was a significant contribution that took the invention outside the equitable bounds of the patent:

We are induced to look with more favor upon this device, not only because it is a novel one and a manifest departure from the principle of the Westinghouse patent, but because it solved at once in the simplest manner the problem of quick [braking] action, whereas the Westinghouse patent did not prove to be a success until certain additional members had been incorporated in it.
Id. at 572 .
According to the Federal Circuit, "because products on which patent claims are readable word for word often are in fact the same, perform the same function in the same way, and achieve the same result, as the claimed invention, a defense based on the reverse doctrine of equivalents is rarely offered." SRI Int'l v. Matsushita Electric Corp. of America, 775 F.2d 1107, 1123 n. 19 (Fed. Cir. 1985); see also Tate Access Floors, Inc. v. Interface Architectural Resources, Inc., 279 F.3d 1357 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (coming close to sounding the death knell for the reverse DOE).

The Federal Circuit has, however, applied the doctrine to reverse a finding of infringement in Scripps Clinic \& Research Foundation v. Genentech, Inc., 927 F.2d 1565 (Fed. Cir. 1991), a case typical of an early wave of biotechnology patent actions. Genentech invented and patented the recombinant DNA form of the blood protein Factor VIII:C, a blood clotting agent made by the body and useful in treating patients with clotting disorders. Scripps had previously obtained a patent on purified Factor VIII:C, which it made by isolating and purifying the protein from raw human blood. Scripps sued Genentech for infringement of its product patent, citing the conventional rule that a product patent covers the product no matter how it is made. After attempting to distinguish its recombinant version from Scripps' purified natural protein, Genentech ultimately relied on a pragmatic defense: that the recombinant version was by far cheaper to make, and therefore ought not to be deemed an infringement. The Federal Circuit remanded the case for a determination whether the reverse doctrine of equivalents applied in these circumstances. Since Tate Access, the Federal Circuit has gone out of its way on several occasions to make it clear that the reverse doctrine of equivalents, while rare, does still have viability. See, e.g., Amgen, Inc. v. Hoechst Marion Roussel, 314 F.3d 1313, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2003); Plant Genetic Systems, N.V. v. DeKalb Genetics Corp., 315 F.3d 1335, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2003) ("[T]he judiciallydeveloped 'reverse doctrine of equivalents,' requiring interpretation of claims in light of the specification, may be safely relied upon to preclude improper enforcement against later developers."); but see Steuben Foods, Inc. v. Shibuya Hoppmann Corp., 127 F.4th 348 (Fed. Cir. 2025) (endorsing, in dicta, the argument that Congress eliminated (subsumed) the reverse doctrine of equivalents (RDOE) through its enactment of §112, which imposed strict disclosure and claim scope requirements that are co-extensive with the broadest possible reach of the RDOE).

## PROBLEMS

Problem III-15. Mike Molar, a production engineer for Tasty Toothpaste Corp. (Tasty) hit upon a way to make a sanitary, cheap, and small disposable toothbrush. The problem he had been running into was how to keep the toothbrush small while still providing a feature he thought necessary to make it attractive-a built-in supply of toothpaste. The solution: a small reservoir for holding toothpaste in the handle of the toothbrush. Then the user could squeeze the toothpaste from the reservoir to the brush bristles.

He quickly built a prototype of the invention. To build it, he bought a fountain pen, pulled out the ink cartridge and other parts from the interior, tore the bristles off a toothbrush and glued them onto a hollow tube, poked two holes in the top of the tube between two rows of bristles, fitted up a plastic plunger that slid in and out at the back of the fountain pen body, pulled the plunger all the way out, filled the tube with toothpaste, glued the tube inside the fountain pen body, and pushed the plunger. Voila! Toothpaste came out of the holes more or less onto the bristles, ready for brushing. It worked! He drafted a patent specification that included this passage:

It is one important object of the present invention to provide a portable toothbrush which is easily carried in the pocket and which is thus available whenever it is required for brushing teeth.

The open end of the device includes a reduced section portion which carries the bristles. The cylindrical body shaft includes an interior passage that extends into the reduced section end (i.e., the one with the bristles). The passage includes two termination openings which are in the area at the base of the toothbrush bristles.
An open space for placing toothpaste is provided within the interior passage, and a movable plunger is provided for forcing the toothpaste from this space through the narrow part of the passage and out through the termination openings into the toothpaste bristles for use.

In the preferred embodiment, the body shaft is made of plastic. The invention may be made so as to be disposable. Various means for filling the space with toothpaste are envisioned, including pressure-injection through a small hole in the top of the body, which hole can then be sealed. This would make the toothbrush usable only once; it would then be disposed.
He concluded with the following claim.

1. A pocket toothbrush having an exterior structure resembling a traditional fountain pen case comprising a. a removable cylindrical end cap cover, b. a main cylindrical body shaft over at least one end of which said end cap cover fits and having means for engaging the interior of said end cap cover to retain said end cap cover, c. said cylindrical body shaft having one end which contains toothbrush bristles [the "bristle end"] extending transversely and capable of being confined within said end cap, d. said cylindrical body shaft including an interior passage extending into said bristle end and having at least one termination opening in the area at the base of said bristles, e. a movable plunger extending into said cylindrical body shaft in said main cylindrical body shaft, f. said body shaft including an interior space for the accommodation of a charge of toothpaste to be fed to said bristles by the operation of said movable plunger, said space being at least big enough to hold a charge for a single application of toothpaste.
Once the patent issued, Tasty began selling a disposable, portable toothbrush that garnered a loyal following. Soon competitors entered the market. One, KopyCat Industries, Inc. (KCI), began selling a portable toothbrush that included a replaceable toothpaste cartridge so that the brush housing could be reused. The cartridges have a weak plastic closure that easily breaks when the plunger is pushed against the cartridge. This keeps the toothpaste from hardening in the openings to the bristles. Also, instead of a cap, the KCI design has a telescoping retractable cover that remains attached to the non-bristle end of the brush. The cover is collapsed down, the brush used, and then the cover is pulled back into place. The retractable cover is attached very firmly with two tiny screws. The screws can be taken out and the cover removed, but it takes a tiny jeweler screwdriver and is difficult.

Tasty threatens to sue KCI for infringement of the Molar patent. KCI has come to you for advice. Does KCI run a serious risk of being found liable for infringing the Molar patent, either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents? What changes might KCI make in its product to avoid a future infringement action by Tasty?

Problem III-16. In the early 1960s, Hughes Aircraft invented an apparatus for maintaining a satellite in geosynchronous orbit (i.e., maintaining a constant position relative to a location on earth). Claim 1 of its 1964 patent application claimed an apparatus comprising:
a. a body adapted to spin about an axis;
b. fluid supply means associated with said body;
c. a valve connected to said fluid supply means;
d. fluid expulsion means disposed on said body and coupled with said valve and oriented to expel said fluid substantially along a line parallel to said axis and separated therefrom;
e. means disposed on said body for providing an indication to a location external to said body of the instantaneous spin angle position of said body about said axis and the orientation of said axis with reference to a fixed external coordinate system;
f. and means disposed on said body for receiving from said location control signals synchronized with said indication;
g. said valve being coupled to said last-named means and responsive to said control signals for applying fluid to said fluid expulsion means in synchronism therewith for precessing said body to orient said axis in a predetermined desired relationship with said fixed external coordinate system.

Step e refers to "means disposed on said body for providing an indication to a location external to said body of the instantaneous spin angle position." Step f refers to "means disposed on said body for receiving from said location control signals synchronized with said indication." At the time that the invention was made, computer technology was relatively primitive. Consequently, it needed to perform the complex calculations necessary to maintain geosynchronous orbit using a mainframe computer located on earth. The patent issued in 1973.

By that time, microprocessor technology had advanced to the point that computers could be substantially reduced in size. NASA developed a satellite that utilized key elements of the Hughes Aircraft system -i.e., taking "instantaneous spin angle position of said body about said axis and the orientation of said axis with reference to a fixed external coordinate system"-and. determining the necessary precession of jets to maintain geosynchronous orbit. But due to advances in microprocessor technology, it could do the entire position adjustment process on board the satellite, i.c., it did not need to send positional information to the earth and receive the adjustment information. Hughes sued for infringement. Under modern infringement doctrines, what are NASA's best arguments to defeat the infringement claim? What are Hughes best counterarguments? How should the judge/jury resolve the case?
