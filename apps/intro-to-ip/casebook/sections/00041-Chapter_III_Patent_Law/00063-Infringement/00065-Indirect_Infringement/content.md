Tort law principles have long extended liability beyond those who directly commit a tort to those who aid, abet, contribute, and induce violations of property and personal interests. Since patent law traces its infringement principles to tort law, inducement and contributory infringement evolved to address infringing activity that lacked the element of a direct making, using, or selling of the patented invention. These doctrines were codified in the 1952 Act, yet they still retain a common law character. They bring into play the mental state-knowledge and intent-of the alleged infringer.

## i. Inducement

Section 271 (b) provides that "Whoever actively induces infringement of a patent shall be liable as an infringer." Inducement involves behavior that omits any direct making, using, or selling of the patented invention but that nevertheless amounts to an attempt to appropriate the value of an invention. It is often described as activity that "aids and abets" infringement. Although inducing infringement commonly involves instructing another to violate a patent, this branch of liability is broad enough to ensnare a host of diverse activities.

## Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S.A. Supreme Court of the United States 563 U.S. 754 (2011)

JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.
We consider whether a party who "actively induces infringement of a patent" under 35 U.S.C. §271 (b) must know that the induced acts constitute patent infringement.

## I

This case concerns a patent for an innovative deep fryer designed by respondent SEB S.A., a French maker of home appliances. In the late 1980's, SEB invented a "cool- touch" deep fryer, that is, a deep fryer for home use with external surfaces that remain cool during the frying process. The cool-touch deep fryer consisted of a metal frying pot surrounded by a plastic outer housing. Attached to the housing was a ring that suspended the metal pot and insulated the housing from heat by separating it from the pot, creating air space between the two components. SEB obtained a U.S. patent for its design in 1991, and sometime later, SEB started manufacturing the cool-touch fryer and selling it in this country under its well-known "T-Fal" brand. Superior to other products in the American market at the time, SEB's fryer was a commercial success.

In 1997, Sunbeam Products, Inc., a U.S. competitor of SEB, asked petitioner Pentalpha Enterprises, Ltd., to supply it with deep fryers meeting certain specifications. Pentalpha is a Hong Kong maker of home appliances and a wholly owned subsidiary of petitioner Global-Tech Appliances, Inc.

In order to develop a deep fryer for Sunbeam, Pentalpha purchased an SEB fryer in Hong Kong and copied all but its cosmetic features. Because the SEB fryer bought in Hong Kong was made for sale in a foreign market, it bore no U.S. patent markings. After copying SEB's design, Pentalpha retained an attorney to conduct a right-to-use study, but Pentalpha refrained from telling the attorney that its design was copied directly from SEB's.

The attorney failed to locate SEB's patent, and in August 1997 he issued an opinion letter stating that Pentalpha's deep fryer did not infringe any of the patents that he had found. That same month, Pentalpha started selling its deep fryers to Sunbeam, which resold them in the United States under its trademarks. By obtaining its product from a manufacturer with lower production costs, Sunbeam was able to undercut SEB in the U.S. market.

After SEB's customers started defecting to Sunbeam, SEB sued Sunbeam in March 1998, alleging that Sunbeam's sales infringed SEB's patent. Sunbeam notified Pentalpha of the lawsuit the following month. Undeterred, Pentalpha went on to sell deep fryers to Fingerhut Corp. and Montgomery Ward \& Co., both of which resold them in the United States under their respective trademarks. . . .

# II 

Pentalpha argues that active inducement liability under §271 (b) requires more than deliberate indifference to a known risk that the induced acts may violate an existing patent. Instead, Pentalpha maintains, actual knowledge of the patent is needed.

## A

In assessing Pentalpha's argument, we begin with the text of §271 (b)-which is short, simple, and, with respect to the question presented in this case, inconclusive. Section 271(b) states: "Whoever actively induces infringement of a patent shall be liable as an infringer."

Although the text of §271 (b) makes no mention of intent, we infer that at least some intent is required. The term "induce" means " [t] o lead on; to influence; to prevail on; to move by persuasion or influence." Webster's New International Dictionary 1269 (2d ed.1945). The addition of the adverb "actively" suggests that the inducement must involve the taking of affirmative steps to bring about the desired result, see id., at 27.

When a person actively induces another to take some action, the inducer obviously knows the action that he or she wishes to bring about. If a used car salesman induces a customer to buy a car, the salesman knows that the desired result is the purchase of the car. But what if it is said that the salesman induced the customer to buy a damaged car? Does this mean merely that the salesman induced the customer to purchase a car that happened to be damaged, a fact of which the salesman may have been unaware? Or does this mean that the salesman knew that the car was damaged? The statement that the salesman induced the customer to buy a damaged car is ambiguous.

1
So is §271 (b). In referring to a party that "induces infringement," this provision may require merely that the inducer lead another to engage in conduct that happens to amount to infringement, i.e., the making, using, offering to sell, selling, or importing of a patented invention. See §271(a).^2 On the other hand, the reference to a party that "induces infringement" may also be read to mean that the inducer must persuade another to engage in conduct that the inducer knows is infringement. Both readings are possible. . . .

While both the language of §271 (b) and the pre-1952 case law that this provision was meant to codify are susceptible to conflicting interpretations, our decision in [Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., 377 U.S. 476 (1964) (Aro II)] resolves the question in this case. In Aro II, a majority held that a violator of §271 (c) must know "that the combination for which his component was especially designed was both patented and infringing," 377 U.S., at 488, and as we explain below, that conclusion compels this same knowledge for liability under §271(b).

# C 

As noted above, induced infringement was not considered a separate theory of indirect liability in the pre-1952 case law. Rather, it was treated as evidence of "contributory infringement," that is, the aiding and abetting of direct infringement by another party. See Lemley, Inducing Patent Infringement, 39 U.C.D. L. REV. 225, 227 (2005). When Congress enacted §271, it separated what had previously been regarded as contributory infringement into two categories, one covered by §271 (b) and the other covered by §271 (c).

Aro II concerned §271 (c), which states in relevant part:
"Whoever offers to sell or sells . . . a component of a patented [invention] ..., constituting a material part of the invention, knowing the same to be especially made or especially adapted for use in an infringement of such patent, and not a staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use, shall be liable as a contributory infringer." (Emphasis added.)
This language contains exactly the same ambiguity as §271 (b). The phrase "knowing [a component] to be especially made or especially adapted for use in an infringement" may be read to mean that a violator must know that the component is "especially adapted for use" in a product that happens to infringe a patent. Or the phrase may be read to require, in addition, knowledge of the patent's existence.

This question closely divided the Aro II Court. In a badly fractured decision, a majority concluded that knowledge of the patent was needed. 377 U.S., at 488, and n. 8 (White, J., concurring); id., at 524-527 (Black, J., dissenting). Justice Black's opinion, which explained the basis for the majority's view, concluded that the language of §271 (c) supported this interpretation. See id., at 525 . His opinion also relied on an amendment to this language that was adopted when the bill was in committee. Id., at 525-527.

Four Justices disagreed with this interpretation and would have held that a violator of §271 (c) need know only that the component is specially adapted for use in a product that happens to infringe a patent. See id., at 488-490, n. 8. These Justices thought that this reading was supported by the language of §271 (c) and the pre-1952 case law, and they disagreed with the inference drawn by the majority from the amendment of §271(c)'s language. Ibid.

While there is much to be said in favor of both views expressed in Aro II, the "holding in Aro II has become a fixture in the law of contributory infringement under [section] 271(c)," 5 R. MOY, WALKER ON PATENTS §15:20, p. 15-131 (4th ed.2009)so much so that SEB has not asked us to overrule it. Nor has Congress seen fit to alter §271(c)'s intent requirement in the nearly half a century since Aro II was decided. In light of the "special force'" of the doctrine of stare decisis with regard to questions of statutory interpretation, see John R. Sand \& Gravel Co. v. United States, 552 U.S. 130, 139 (2008), we proceed on the premise that §271 (c) requires knowledge of the existence of the patent that is infringed.

Based on this premise, it follows that the same knowledge is needed for induced infringement under §271 (b). As noted, the two provisions have a common origin in the pre-1952 understanding of contributory infringement, and the language of the two provisions creates the same difficult interpretive choice. It would thus be strange to hold that knowledge of the relevant patent is needed under §271 (c) but not under §271 (b).

# 2 

Accordingly, we now hold that induced infringement under §271 (b) requires knowledge that the induced acts constitute patent infringement.

III Returning to Pentalpha's principal challenge, we agree that deliberate indifference to a known risk that a patent exists is not the appropriate standard under §271 (b). We nevertheless affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals because the evidence in this case was plainly sufficient to support a finding of Pentalpha's knowledge under the doctrine of willful blindness.

# A 

The doctrine of willful blindness is well established in criminal law. Many criminal statutes require proof that a defendant acted knowingly or willfully, and courts applying the doctrine of willful blindness hold that defendants cannot escape the reach of these statutes by deliberately shielding themselves from clear evidence of critical facts that are strongly suggested by the circumstances. The traditional rationale for this doctrine is that defendants who behave in this manner are just as culpable as those who have actual knowledge. Edwards, The Criminal Degrees of Knowledge, 17 Mod. L. Rev. 294, 302 (1954) (hereinafter Edwards) (observing on the basis of English authorities that "up to the present day, no real doubt has been cast on the proposition that [willful blindness] is as culpable as actual knowledge"). It is also said that persons who know enough to blind themselves to direct proof of critical facts in effect have actual knowledge of those facts. See United States v. Jewell, 532 F.2d 697, 700 (C.A. 9 1976) (en banc).

This Court's opinion more than a century ago in Spurr v. United States, 174 U.S. 728 (1899), while not using the term "willful blindness," endorsed a similar concept. . . . Following our decision in Spurr, several federal prosecutions in the first half of the 20th century invoked the doctrine of willful blindness. Later, a 1962 proposed draft of the Model Penal Code, which has since become official, attempted to incorporate the doctrine by defining "knowledge of the existence of a particular fact" to include a situation in which "a person is aware of a high probability of [the fact's] existence, unless he actually believes that it does not exist." ALI, MODEL PENAL CODE §2.02(7) (Proposed Official Draft 1962). . . .

Given the long history of willful blindness and its wide acceptance in the Federal Judiciary, we can see no reason why the doctrine should not apply in civil lawsuits for induced patent infringement under 35 U.S.C. §271(b). . . .

## B

## 3

While the Courts of Appeals articulate the doctrine of willful blindness in slightly different ways, all appear to agree on two basic requirements: (1) the defendant must subjectively believe that there is a high probability that a fact exists and (2) the defendant must take deliberate actions to avoid learning of that fact. We think these requirements give willful blindness an appropriately limited scope that surpasses recklessness and negligence. Under this formulation, a willfully blind defendant is one who takes deliberate actions to avoid confirming a high probability of wrongdoing and who can almost be said to have actually known the critical facts. See G. Williams, Criminal LAW §57, p. 159 (2d ed. 1961) ("A court can properly find wilful blindness only where it can almost be said that the defendant actually knew"). By contrast, a reckless defendant is one who merely knows of a substantial and unjustified risk of such wrongdoing, see ALI, Model Penal CODE $2.02(2) (c) (1985), and a negligent defendant is one who should have known of a similar risk but, in fact, did not, see $2.02(2)(d).

The test applied by the Federal Circuit in this case departs from the proper willful blindness standard in two important respects. First, it permits a finding of knowledge when there is merely a "known risk" that the induced acts are infringing. Second, in demanding only "deliberate indifference" to that risk, the Federal Circuit's test does not require active efforts by an inducer to avoid knowing about the infringing nature of the activities.

In spite of these flaws, we believe that the evidence when viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict for SEB is sufficient under the correct standard. The jury could have easily found that before April 1998 Pentalpha willfully blinded itself to the infringing nature of the sales it encouraged Sunbeam to make.

SEB's cool-touch fryer was an innovation in the U.S. market when Pentalpha copied it. As one would expect with any superior product, sales of SEB's fryer had been growing for some time. Pentalpha knew all of this, for its CEO and president, John Sham, testified that, in developing a product for Sunbeam, Pentalpha performed "market research" and "gather[ed] information as much as possible." Pentalpha's belief that SEB's fryer embodied advanced technology that would be valuable in the U.S. market is evidenced by its decision to copy all but the cosmetic features of SEB's fryer.

Also revealing is Pentalpha's decision to copy an overseas model of SEB's fryer. Pentalpha knew that the product it was designing was for the U.S. market, and Shamhimself a named inventor on numerous U.S. patents-was well aware that products made for overseas markets usually do not bear U.S. patent markings. Even more telling is Sham's decision not to inform the attorney from whom Pentalpha sought a right-touse opinion that the product to be evaluated was simply a knockoff of SEB's deep fryer. On the facts of this case, we cannot fathom what motive Sham could have had for withholding this information other than to manufacture a claim of plausible deniability in the event that his company was later accused of patent infringement. Nor does Sham's testimony on this subject provide any reason to doubt that inference. Asked whether the attorney would have fared better had he known of SEB's design, Sham was nonresponsive. All he could say was that a patent search is not an "easy job" and that is why he hired attomeys to perform them.

Taken together, this evidence was more than sufficient for a jury to find that Pentalpha subjectively believed there was a high probability that SEB's fryer was patented, that Pentalpha took deliberate steps to avoid knowing that fact, and that it therefore willfully blinded itself to the infringing nature of Sunbeam's sales.

The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is Affirmed.
# COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS 

1. Inducemert, like contributory infringement, requires direct patent infringement by another. Someone must actually "make, use, sell, offer for sale, or import" under §271 (a). The inducer is "indirectly liable" for encouraging, aiding, and abetting the direct infringer. Because the alleged inducer is not a direct infringer, it may be liable for acts that do not themselves directly violate the patent statute. This explains why some level of knowledge or intent is required: only if the inducer did what it did with the aim and plan of causing an infringing act is it reasonable to find the inducer liable under the patent statute. (There is no knowledge or intent requirement for a direct infringer; this is why an innocent independent inventor can still be liable for patent infringement. See Robert P. Merges, A Few Kind Words for Absolute Infringement Liability in Patent Law, 31 BERKELEY TECH. L. J. 1 (2016)).

Who were the direct infringers in the Globaltech case? Why did SEB, the patentee, not sue them? If they were foreign manufacturers, perhaps no one "made" an infringing product within the U.S. Hence, such entities would not be liable under U.S. patent law due to the patent law's territoriality limits. How about the retailers selling the infringing fryers in stores in the U.S.? Perhaps SEB did not want to antagonize them, hoping they would sell its fryers at some point. The point is that sometimes, the party the patentee may want to sue is not itself a direct infringer. This means that a complex interplay of strategy and legal principles may be involved. Perhaps SEB wanted to go after the design company that prepared the plans for the infringing fryer - this potential defendant was reachable in the U.S., and perhaps SEB wanted to send a warning not to copy future SEB designs. Whatever the motivation, the point is that by choosing to sue an indirect infringer SEB brought issues of knowledge and intent into the case that are not a problem when suit is brought against a direct infringer.
2. This case illustrates both the similarities and the differences between indirect liability in patent law and tort law. Although the Court begins with the terse statutory standard as well as a dictionary definition, it draws heavily upon the knowledge/intent standards in tort and criminal law in developing the mental state requirement for active inducement under patent law. At the same time, the focus of intent is different. In patent law, unlike tort law, the defendant must know its act is unlawful. Why the difference?
3. Imputed Knowledge. Notwithstanding the Court's conclusion that patent inducement "requires knowledge that the induced acts constitute patent infringement," the court nonetheless opens up a broad inquiry by considering willful blindness to establish such knowledge. In dissent, Justice Kennedy contends that "[w]illful blindness is not knowledge; and judges should not broaden a legislative proscription by analogy." Global-Tech, 563 U.S. at 772 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). He concludes by noting that "[i]f willful blindness is as close to knowledge and as far from the 'knew or should have known' jury instruction provided in this case as the Court suggests, then reviewing the record becomes all the more difficult. I would leave that task to the Court of Appeals in the first instance on remand." Id. at 775.
4. Belief of Invalidity Not a Defense to Inducement. Since the Global-Tech Court concluded that "induced infringement . . . requires knowledge that the induced acts constitute patent infringement," it could reasonably be inferred that a good faith belief that the patent is invalid would negate the requisite intent for inducement liability. After all, how could one have an intent to infringe an invalid patent? Cisco Systems made this argument in defending Commil USA's induced infringement claim. The Supreme Court, in a decision authored by Justice Kennedy, the lone dissenter in Global-Tech, held that a defendant's belief as to validity does not have any bearing on induced infringement. Commil USA, LLC v. Cisco Systems, Inc., 575 U.S. 632 (2015). The Court reasoned The scienter element for induced infringement concerns infringement; that is a different issue than validity. Section 271 (b) requires that the defendant "actively induce[d] infringement." That language requires intent to "bring about the desired result," which is infringement. And because infringement and validity are separate issues under the Act, belief regarding validity cannot negate the scienter required under §271 (b).

When infringement is the issue, the validity of the patent is not the question to be confronted. . . .

Indeed, the issues of infringement and validity appear in separate parts of the Patent Act. . . . Further, noninfringement and invalidity are listed as two separate defenses . . . .

Allowing this new defense would also undermine [patent law's presumption of validity]. . . .
Id. at 1928. Does this make sense to you? Justice Scalia was not persuaded: "[i]nfringing a patent means invading a patentee's exclusive right to practice his claimed invention. Only valid patents confer exclusivity-invalid patents do not. It follows, as night the day, that only valid patents can be infringed. To talk of infringing an invalid patent is to talk nonsense." Id. at 1931 (Scalia, J. dissenting).

# ii. Contributory Infringement 

Section 271 (c) provides that Whoever offers to sell or sells within the United States or imports into the United States a component of a patented machine, manufacture, combination or composition, or a material or apparatus for use in practicing a patented process. constituting a material part of the invention, knowing the same to be especially made or especially adapted for use in an infringement of such patent, and not a staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use, shall be liable as a contributory infringer.
# C.R. Bard, Inc. v. Advanced Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit 911 F.2d 670 (Fed. Cir. 1990) 

## Plager, Circuit Judge.

This is a case of claimed infringement of a method patent for a medical treatment. Defendant-Appellant Advanced Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. (ACS) was marketing [a] perfusion catheter for use in coronary angioplasty. Plaintiff-Appellee C.R. Bard, Inc. (Bard) sued ACS for alleged infringement of U.S. Patent No. 4,581,017 ('017), which Bard had purchased all rights to as of December 31, 1986. The ' 017 patent relates to a method for using a catheter in coronary angioplasty. The district court granted plaintiff Bard summary judgment against ACS, finding infringement of claim 1 of the ' 017 patent. We reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.

Plaintiff Bard alleges that the ACS catheter is especially adapted for use by a surgeon in the course of administering a coronary angioplasty in a manner that infringes claim 1 of the ' 017 patent, that therefore ACS is a contributory infringer, and that ACS actively induces infringement. Of course, a finding of induced or contributory infringement must be predicated on a direct infringement of claim 1 by the users of the ACS catheter.

For purposes of this case, the statute requires that ACS sell a catheter for use in practicing the ' 017 process, which use constitutes a material part of the invention, knowing that the catheter is especially made or adapted for use in infringing the patent, and that the catheter is not a staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use.

In asserting ACS's contributory infringement of claim 1, Bard seeks to establish the requisite direct infringement by arguing that there is no evidence that any angioplasty procedures using the ACS catheter would be noninfringing. Testing this assertion requires a two step analysis. First is a determination of the scope of the claim at issue. Second is an examination of the evidence before the court to ascertain whether, under §271 (c), use of the ACS catheter would infringe the claim as interpreted.

Bard argues that [a] prior art patent teaches the use of the catheter with the inlets (side openings) where the blood enters the tube placed only in the aorta, whereas the ' 017 method in suit involves insertion of the catheter into the coronary artery in such a manner that the openings "immediately adjacent [the] balloon fluidly connect locations within [the] coronary artery surrounding [the] proximal and distal portions of [the] tube." Thus, Bard argues, a surgeon, inserting the ACS catheter into a coronary artery to a point where an inlet at the catheter's proximal end draws blood from the artery, infringes the ' 017 patent.
![img-25.jpeg](img-25.jpeg)
[The aorta is the large blood vessel on top; the coronary artery, labeled 63, is below it.]
[I]t is important to note that the ACS catheter has a series of ten openings in the tube near, and at the proximal end of, the balloon. The first of these openings-the one closest to the balloon [42b in Figure 2 below]-is approximately six millimeters (less than one inch) from the edge of the proximal end of the balloon. The remainder are located along the main lumen at intervals, the furthest from the balloon being 6.3 centimeters (approximately 21/2 inches) away [past 40 b in Figure 2].
![img-26.jpeg](img-26.jpeg)

It would appear that three possible fact patterns may arise in the course of using the ACS catheter. The first pattern involves positioning the catheter such that all of its side openings are located only in the aorta. This is clearly contemplated by the prior art ' 725 patent cited by the examiner. In the second of the possible fact patterns, all of the side openings are located within the coronary artery. This situation appears to have been contemplated by the ' 017 patent, the method patent at issue. In the third fact pattern. some of the side openings are located in the aorta and some are located in the artery.

There is evidence in the record that 40 to 60 percent of the stenoses that require angioplasty are located less than three centimeters from the entrance to the coronary artery. ACS argues that therefore the ACS catheter may be used in such a way that all of the openings are located in the aorta. Even assuming that the trial judge's conclusion is correct that claim 1 is applicable to the third of the fact patterns, it remains true that on this record a reasonable jury could find that, pursuant to the procedure described in the first of the fact pattems (a noninfringing procedure), there are substantial noninfringing uses for the ACS catheter.

Whether the ACS catheter "has no use except through practice of the patented method," Dawson Chemical Co. v. Rohm \& Haas Co., is thus a critical issue to be decided in this case. As the Supreme Court recently noted, "[w]hen a charge of contributory infringement is predicated entirely on the sale of an article of commerce that is used by the purchaser [allegedly] to infringe a patent, the public interest in access to that article of commerce is necessarily implicated." Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 440 (198[4]) [declining to find contributory copyright infringement in sale of video cassette recorders]. Viewing the evidence in this case in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and resolving reasonable inferences in ACS's favor, it cannot be said that Bard is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The grant of summary judgment finding ACS a contributory infringer under §271 (c) is not appropriate.

# COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS 

1. While Bard sued ACS, a competing manufacturer of catheters, the "real" infringer in this case is the doctor who completed the catheterization under circumstances that violated Bard's patent. What should doctors do in such a situation? Refuse to perform procedures that infringe a patent? Seek a license? In 1996, Congress amended the patent laws to exempt doctors who perform medical processes from liability for infringement, rendering this problem moot. However, Congress left device manufacturers liable for contributory infringement of such patents. See §287.
2. A classic example of inducement/contributory infringement is the sale of device components or "replacement parts" for a patented device, even though the parts themselves constitute less than the complete device and hence do not directly infringe. Contributory infringement is often used to attack sellers of parts where the actual ultimate infringers are end-users who replace parts or assemble components. The law draws a line between repair of an existing patented product, which is permissible, and reconstruction of the product, which isn't. See, e.g., Aro Mfg. Corp. v. Convertible Top Co., 377 U.S. 176 (1964); Husky Injection Molding Systems, Ltd. v. R\&D Tool Engineering Co., 291 F.3d 780 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Another example is the sale of products with instructions that assist buyers in employing a process that infringes a process patent. See Dawson Chem. Co. v. Rohm \& Haas, Inc., 448 U.S. 176 (1980).
3. If an unpatented product has no other use except in conjunction with the patented machine, process or product, is it reasonable automatically to presume that making, using or selling the unpatented product is contributory infringement? Or should companies be allowed to compete in the market for non-staple products that work with the patented invention? For a discussion of these issues, see Dawson Chem. Co. v. Rohm \& Haas, Inc., 448 U.S. 176 (1980); Husky Injection Molding Systems, Ltd. v. R\&D Tool Engineering Co., 291 F.3d 780 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Section 271 (c) says that whoever sells or imports a component "constituting a material part of the invention, knowing the same to be especially made or especially adapted for use in an infringement of such patent, and not a staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use" will be an infringer. Notice how this parallels the knowledge or intent requirement for inducement, which was the subject of the Globaltech case.

# iii. Joint Infringement 

How does patent law handle situations where no single person or entity performs all the acts required to infringe a claim? In BMC Resources, Inc. v. Paymentech, L.P., 498 F.3d 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2007), the patent owner brought suit for infringement of its patented method for processing debit transactions without a personal identification number (PIN). The accused infringer, Paymentech, showed that the claimed process involved performance of the following steps:

1. The customer calls a merchant to pay a bill;
2. The merchant collects payment information from the customer and sends it to Paymentech;
3. Paymentech routes the information to a participating debit network;
4. The debit network forwards the information to an affiliated financial institution;
5. The financial institution authorizes or declines the transaction, and if authorized, charges the customer's account according to the payment information collected by the merchant; and 6. Information regarding the status of the transaction moves from the financial institution to the debit network and then, through Paymentech, to the merchant who informs the customer of the status of the transaction.
Because some of these steps were neither performed by Paymentech nor with its active guidance or control, no single entity performed all the steps of the claim. Therefore, no direct infringement occurred. The court pointed out that more attentive claim drafting might have produced a claim that was infringed by a single entity such as Paymentech. see Mark A. Lemley, David O'Brien, Ryan M. Kent, Ashok Ramani, \& Robert Van Nast, Divided Infringement Claims, 33 AIPLA Q.J. 255, 272-75 (2005), although not all inventions involving multiple actions can feasibly be confined to a single actor. The court further observed that if a single "mastermind" had centrally coordinated all the infringing steps among multiple actors, that mastermind would be liable for inducement under vicarious liability principles. 498 F.3d at 1381.

The next year, another Federal Circuit panel held that when multiple actors belonging to distinct enterprises collectively practice the steps of a process patent, there is no infringement liability unless one organization controls, directly or via contract, the actions of the others. Furthermore, a mere relationship between parties-such as providing access to a system and instructing users on the system's use-cannot establish "control or direction" required for inducement. Muniatiction, Inc. v. Thomson Corp., 532 F.3d 1318 (Fed. Cir. 2008).
This standard for liability did not sit well with several members of the Federal Circuit. In 2012, the court reconsidered this rule en banc and concluded that an actor could be held liable for inducing infringement even if all of the steps in a patented process were not committed by a single entity. See Akamai Technologies, Inc. v. Limelight Networks, Inc., 692 F.3d 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (per curiam) (en banc). The majority based its analysis on legislative history of the 1952 Act, quoting testimony by Giles Rich, one of the principal drafters:

Improvements in such arts as radio communication, television, etc., sometimes involve the new combinations of elements which in use are normally owned by different persons. Thus, a new method of radio communication may involve a change in the transmitter and a corresponding change in the receiver. To describe such an invention in patent claims, it is necessary either to specify a new method which involves both transmitting and receiving, or a new combination of an element in the receiver and an element in the transmitter. There are patents with such claims covering television inventions of importance.

The recent decisions of the Supreme Court [the cases targeted by the statutory changes] appear to make it impossible to enforce such patents in the usual case where a radio transmitter and a radio receiver are owned and operated by different persons, for, while there is obvious infringement of the patent, there is no direct infringer of the patent but only two contributory infringers.
Contributory Infringement of Patents: Hearings Before the Subcomm. on Patents, Trade-marks, and COPYRIGHTS OF THE H. COMm. ON THE JUDICIARY, 80th Cong. 5 (1948) (statement of G. Rich on behalf of the New York Patent Law Association) (emphasis added) (quoted in Akamai, 692. F.4d at 1310). Mr. (later Judge) Rich's statement indicates that "the 'obvious infringement' should be remediable, even though 'there is no direct infringer' of the patent." Akamai, 692. F.3d at 1311.

Judge Linn, joined by three colleagues, accused the majority of "assum[ing] the mantle of policy maker." The dissenters emphasized that both the Patent Act and Supreme Court precedent-Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., 365 U.S. 336, 341 (1961); Deepsouth Packing Co. v. Laitram Corp., 406 U.S. 518, 526 (1972)clearly establish that there can be no indirect liability of a patent without direct infringement. "Section 271, paragraph (a), is a declaration of what constitutes infringement," H.R. REP. No. 82-1923, at 9 (1952) (emphasis added), and §271(b) and (c) liability is built on that foundation. Akamai, 692. F.3d at 1338 (Linn, J., dissenting). It also criticized the majority for reading the term "infringement" to mean two different things in two different subsections of the statute.

This split prompted the Supreme Court to weigh in. The Supreme Court reversed the Federal Circuit for the reasons articulated by Judge Linn. See Limelight Networks, Inc. v. Akamai Technologies, Inc., 572 U.S. 915 (2014). Nonetheless, the Court noted that the "problem" sought to be resolved by the Federal Circuit's en banc opinion in Akamai was created by the Federal Circuit in its decision in Muniatiction-the rule that when multiple actors belonging to distinct enterprises collectively practice the steps of a process patent, there is no infringement liability unless one organization exercises direct supervisory or contractual control direct supervisory or contractual control over the actions of the other actor(s).

On remand, the full court, sua sponte, issued the following opinion.

# Akamai Technologies, Inc. v. Limelight Networks, Inc., Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit 797 F.3d 1020 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (en banc) 

## PER CURIAM.

This case was returned to us by the United States Supreme Court, noting "the possibility that [we] erred by too narrowly circumscribing the scope of §271 (a)" and suggesting that we "will have the opportunity to revisit the §271 (a) question. . . ." We hereby avail ourselves of that opportunity.

Sitting en banc, we unanimously set forth the law of divided infringement under 35 U.S.C. §271 (a). We conclude that, in this case, substantial evidence supports the jury's finding that Limelight Networks, Inc. ("Limelight") directly infringes U.S. Patent 6,108,703 (the " 703 patent") under §271 (a). We therefore reverse the district court's grant of judgment of noninfringement as a matter of law.

## I. DIVIDED INFRINGEMENT

Direct infringement under §271 (a) occurs where all steps of a claimed method are performed by or attributable to a single entity. See BMC Res., Inc. v. Paymentech, L.P., 498 F.3d 1373, 1379-81 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Where more than one actor is involved in practicing the steps, a court must determine whether the acts of one are attributable to the other such that a single entity is responsible for the infringement. We will hold an entity responsible for others' performance of method steps in two sets of circumstances: (1) where that entity directs or controls others' performance, and (2) where the actors form a joint enterprise.

To determine if a single entity directs or controls the acts of another, we continue to consider general principles of vicarious liability. In the past, we have held that an actor is liable for infringement under §271 (a) if it acts through an agent (applying traditional agency principles) or contracts with another to perform one or more steps of a claimed method. See BMC, 498 F.3d at 1380-81. We conclude, on the facts of this case, that liability under §271 (a) can also be found when an alleged infringer conditions participation in an activity or receipt of a benefit upon performance of a step or steps of a patented method and establishes the manner or timing of that performance. Cf. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., 545 U.S. 913, 930 (2005) (stating that an actor "infringes vicariously by profiting from direct infringement" if that actor has the right and ability to stop or limit the infringement). In those instances, the third party's actions are attributed to the alleged infringer such that the alleged infringer becomes the single actor chargeable with direct infringement. Whether a single actor directed or controlled the acts of one or more third parties is a question of fact, reviewable on appeal for substantial evidence, when tried to a jury.
Alternatively, where two or more actors form a joint enterprise, all can be charged with the acts of the other, rendering each liable for the steps performed by the other as if each is a single actor. See RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS §491 cmt. b ("The law ... considers that each is the agent or servant of the others, and that the act of any one within the scope of the enterprise is to be charged vicariously against the rest."). A joint enterprise requires proof of four elements:
(1) an agreement, express or implied, among the members of the group;
(2) a common purpose to be carried out by the group;
(3) a community of pecuniary interest in that purpose, among the members; and (4) an equal right to a voice in the direction of the enterprise, which gives an equal right of control.
Id. §491 cmt. c. As with direction or control, whether actors entered into a joint enterprise is a question of fact, reviewable on appeal for substantial evidence. Id. ("Whether these elements exist is frequently a question for the jury, under proper direction from the court.").

We believe these approaches to be most consistent with the text of §271 (a), the statutory context in which it appears, the legislative purpose behind the Patent Act, and our past case law. Section 271 (a) is not limited solely to principal-agent relationships, contractual arrangements, and joint enterprise, as the vacated panel decision held. Rather, to determine direct infringement, we consider whether all method steps can be attributed to a single entity.

# II. APPLICATION TO THE FACTS OF THIS CASE 

Today we outline the governing legal framework for direct infringement and address the facts presented by this case. In the future, other factual scenarios may arise which warrant attributing others' performance of method steps to a single actor. Going forward, principles of attribution are to be considered in the context of the particular facts presented.
... In 2006, Akamai Technologies, Inc. ("Akamai") filed a patent infringement action against Limelight alleging infringement of several patents, including the '703 patent, which claims methods for delivering content over the Internet.
[Claim 34 provides:
A content delivery method, comprising:
distributing a set of page objects across a network of content servers managed by a domain other than a content provider domain, wherein the network of content servers are organized into a set of regions;
for a given page normally served from the content provider domain, tagging at least some of the embedded objects of the page so that requests for the objects resolve to the domain instead of the content provider domain;
in response to a client request for an embedded object of the page:
resolving the client request as a function of a location of the client machine making the request and current Internet traffic conditions to identify a given region; and returning to the client an IP address of a given one of the content servers within the given region that is likely to host the embedded object and that is not overloaded.

Figure 3
The case proceeded to trial, at which the parties agreed that Limelight's customers-not Limelight—perform the "tagging" and "serving" steps in the claimed methods. For example, as for claim 34 of the '703 patent, Limelight performs every step save the "tagging" step, in which Limelight's customers tag the content to be hosted and delivered by Limelight's content delivery network. After the close of evidence, the district judge instructed the jury that Limelight is responsible for its customers' performance of the tagging and serving method steps if Limelight directs or controls its customers' activities. The jury found that Limelight infringed claims 19, 20, 21, and 34 of the '703 patent. Following post-trial motions, the district court first denied Limelight's motion for judgment of noninfringement as a matter of law, ruling that Akamai had presented substantial evidence that Limelight directed or controlled its customers. After we decided Muniauction, Inc. v. Thomson Corp., 532 F.3d 1318 (Fed. Cir. 2008), the district court granted Limelight's motion for reconsideration, holding as a matter of law that there could be no liability.

We reverse and reinstate the jury verdict. The jury heard substantial evidence from which it could find that Limelight directs or controls its customers' performance of each remaining method step, such that all steps of the method are attributable to Limelight. Specifically, Akamai presented substantial evidence demonstrating that Limelight conditions its customers' use of its content delivery network upon its customers' performance of the tagging and serving steps, and that Limelight establishes the manner or timing of its customers' performance. We review the evidence supporting "conditioning use of the content delivery network" and "establishing the manner or timing of performance" in turn.

First, the jury heard evidence that Limelight requires all of its customers to sign a standard contract. The contract delineates the steps customers must perform if they use the Limelight service. These steps include tagging and serving content. As to tagging, Limelight's form contract provides: "Customer shall be responsible for identifying via the then current [Limelight] process all [URLs] of the Customer Content to enable such Customer Content to be delivered by the [Limelight network]." In addition, the contract requires that Limelight's customers "provide [Limelight] with all cooperation and information reasonably necessary for [Limelight] to implement the [Content Delivery Service]." As for the serving step, the form contract states that Limelight is not responsible for failures in its content delivery network caused by its customers' failure to serve content. If a customer's server is down, Limelight's content delivery network need not perform. Thus, if Limelight's customers wish to use Limelight's product, they must tag and serve content. Accordingly, substantial evidence indicates that Limelight conditions customers' use of its content delivery network upon its customers' performance of the tagging and serving method steps.

Substantial evidence also supports finding that Limelight established the manner or timing of its customers' performance. Upon completing a deal with Limelight, Limelight sends its customer a welcome letter instructing the customer how to use Limelight's service. In particular, the welcome letter tells the customer that a Technical Account Manager employed by Limelight will lead the implementation of Limelight's services. The welcome letter also contains a hostname assigned by Limelight that the customer "integrate[s] into [its] webpages." This integration process includes the tagging step. Moreover, Limelight provides step-by-step instructions to its customers telling them how to integrate Limelight's hostname into its webpages if the customer wants to act as the origin for content. If Limelight's customers do not follow these precise steps, Limelight's service will not be available. Limelight's Installation Guidelines give Limelight customers further information on tagging content. Lastly, the jury heard evidence that Limelight's engineers continuously engage with customers' activities. Initially, Limelight's engineers assist with installation and perform quality assurance testing. The engineers remain available if the customer experiences any problems. In sum, Limelight's customers do not merely take Limelight's guidance and act independently on their own. Rather, Limelight establishes the manner and timing of its customers' performance so that customers can only avail themselves of the service upon their performance of the method steps.

We conclude that the facts Akamai presented at trial constitute substantial evidence from which a jury could find that Limelight directed or controlled its customers' performance of each remaining method step. As such, substantial evidence supports the jury's verdict that all steps of the claimed methods were performed by or attributable to Limelight. Therefore, Limelight is liable for direct infringement.
# COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS 

1. Does this standard fundamentally change the law to allow joint infringement thcorics, or merely broaden the scope of §271 (a) to ensnare a relatively small subset of joint enterprises? The new joint enterprise theory of vicarious infringement attaches liability "when an alleged infringer conditions participation in an activity or receipt of a benefit upon performance of a [method step] and establishes the manner or timing of that performance." This is a looser type of control than the more rigid tests rejected by the Federal Circuit on remand from the Supreme Court. See Olajumoke Obayanju, What Next? Exploring the Federal Circuit's Expansion of Direct Infringement Liability PostAkamai v. Limelight and the Process It Took to Get There, 25 FED. CIRCUIT B.J. 319, 332 (2016). Because of the looser standard, more product sellers and service providers may be liable than under the previous test. Is there any way for these parties and their clients to contractually allocate the risk of infringement?
2. Suppose the contract had been silent on what the customers would do. Would the result change? Should it? What if the software were designed so that the customer had no choice; the software "pulled" information on tagged objects directly from the customer. Would the customer's assent to the overall service constitute acceptance of the service provider's control over the "manner and timing of performance"?

## PROBLEM III-17

Nichols, a scientist who enjoys puzzles, designs a "rotating cube" puzzle in which each face of the cube is composed of a number of smaller cubes, each face is initially of a different color, and the object of the puzzle is to restore the original color scheme once it has been disturbed. Nichols obtains a patent on a method of solving this puzzle, but not on the physical puzzle itself.

Rubik builds and sells puzzles similar to the ones Nichols has designed. Has Rubik infringed the Nichols patent, either directly or indirectly? Does it matter whether Nichols's patent covers the only known solution to the puzzle, or only one among many possible solutions? What if Rubik's product includes a "cheat" sheet advising buyers how to solve the puzzle using a number of methods, including Nichols's? What if Rubik includes a copy of the Nichols patent with each cube sold, ostensibly to advise users how to avoid infringement, but arguably with the intent of encouraging them to use the Nichols method?

^2 Direct infringement has long been understood to require no more than the unauthorized use of a patented invention. See Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., 377 U.S. 476, 484 (1964); 3 A. Deller, Walker on Patents §453, p. 1684 (1937). Thus, a direct infringer's knowledge or intent is irrelevant.
