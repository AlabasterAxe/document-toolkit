Section 285 provides that the "court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party." The Supreme Court has interpreted this standard to afford district judges discretion to award attorney fees where it finds that the case "simply . . . stands out from others with respect to the substantive strength of a party's litigating position . . . or the unreasonable manner in which the case was litigated." Octane Fitness LLC v. Icon Health \& Fitness Inc., 572 U.S. 545, 554 (2014) (rejecting the Federal Circuit's rule that a defendant may only be awarded fees where it demonstrates that the patentee litigated with subjective bad faith and that the suit was objectively baseless). The Court directed district courts to consider the totality of the circumstances. Such determinations are reviewable for abuse of discretion. Highmark Inc. v. Allcare Health Mgmt. Sys., Inc., 572 U.S. 559, 564 (2014).
