This chapter explores patent law. After a brief survey of the historical origins and an overview of the main contours, we turn to the elements of patentability. Patent law establishes relatively high thresholds for granting what can be extremely valuable exclusive rights. We then turn to claim construction, the delineation of the scope of patent claims. This provides a bridge to examining patent enforcement: infringement, defenses, and remedies. Thereafter, we turn to the increasingly important and controversial area of design patents, which as we will see in Chapters IV and V, overlaps copyright and trade dress protection. We then summarize international patent treaties and institutions. We conclude the chapter by exploring federal preemption of state laws aimed at protecting technology.
