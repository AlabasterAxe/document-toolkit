Willy Wonka is an eccentric and secretive candy maker. His factory has been sealed and closed to the public for many years: as those who live in the area say, “Nobody ever goes in, and nobody ever comes out.” But it produces millions of chocolates and other candies annually.

One day, Wonka announced that he would open his factory to five visitors for a one-day tour. The five visitors would win their tour by finding one of five “golden tickets” hidden inside Wonka chocolate bars. The golden tickets were ultimately found by five children, who became world famous for their lucky finds.

Prior to the day of the tour, each golden ticket holder was secretly approached by a mysterious stranger with a proposition:

"May I introduce myself, Oscar Slugworth, President of Slugworth Chocolates Incorporated. Now listen carefully because I'm going to make you very rich, indeed. Mr. Wonka is at this moment working on a fantastic invention, the Everlasting Gobstopper. If he succeeds, he'll ruin me. So all I want you to do is to get hold of just one Everlasting Gobstopper and bring it to me so that I can find the secret formula.

Your reward will be 10,000 of these. Bring it over with you, a new house for your family, and good food and comfort for the rest of their lives. And don't forget the name, Everlasting Gobstopper."

On the day of the tour, Wonka brought the golden ticket holders (each accompanied by an adult relative) to a locked room within the factory which he referred to as “The Inventing Room” where, he said, “all of my most secret inventions are cooking and simmering.” Wonka unlocked the room but warned his visitors: “No Touching, No Tasting, No Telling!”

As the children looked around, one parent noticed an odd-looking pile of colorful fabric emblazoned with the words “KEEP OUT” and tried to take a peek:


**Willy Wonka:** No, no, please. Forgive me, but no one must look under there. This is the most secret machine in my [00:01:00] entire factory. This is the one that's really going to sizzle old Slugworth. 

**Charlie Bucket:** What's it do? 

**Willy Wonka:** Would you like to see? 

**Children (in unison):** Yeah.

**Charlie Bucket:** But what's it do? 

**Willy Wonka:** And you see it makes Everlasting gobstoppers. 

**Violet Beauregarde:** Did you say everlasting Gobstoppers. 

**Willy Wonka:** That's right. For children with very little pocket money, you can suck 'em forever. I want an everlasting gobstopper. Me too. And me fantastic invention. Revolutionize the industry. You can suck 'em and suck 'em and suck 'em and I'll never get any smaller.

Never. At least, I don't think they do a few more tests.

**Mike Teavee:** How do you make 'em? 

**Willy Wonka:** I am a trifle deaf in this ear. Speak a little louder next time. Who wants an [00:02:00] everlasting gobstopper?

**Children (in unison):** Me! I do! 

**Willy Wonka:** I can only give them to you if you solemnly swear to keep them for yourselves and never show them to another living soul As long as you all shall live.

Agreed. 

**Charlie Bucket:** Agreed. Good 

**Willy Wonka:** one for you and one for you, and one for you.

**Grandpa Joe:** Eh, what about Charlie? 

**Willy Wonka:** And one for Charlie. 

**Veruca Salt:** Hey, she's got two. I want another one. 

**Violet Beauregarde:** Stop. Squawking. You twit.

**Willy Wonka:** Everybody has had one and one is enough for anybody. Now come along.


Question:

Assume that one of the children delivers their Everlasting Gobstopper to Slugworth in exchange for a large sum of money. Assume further that Slugworth uses this Everlasting Gobstopper to reverse engineer Wonka’s secret formula and begin manufacturing and selling Slugworth’s own Everlasting Gobstoppers before Wonka has released his version of the product to the public.

Can Wonka obtain relief under federal law against:

 - Slugworth?
 - The Child who gave Slugworth their Everlasting Gobstopper (ignoring incapacity on the basis of age)?
