# REMARKS

Upon entry of the amendments in this paper, claims 1-15 and 17 will be pending in this application. Claims 1, 14, and 15 are herein amended. Claim 16 is cancelled. Claim 17 has been added. No new matter has been entered by way of this amendment. It is submitted that this paper is fully responsive to the Office Action mailed on [DATE].

**Examiner Interview:**

Applicant thanks the examiner for courteously conducting an interview with applicant's representative on August 13, 2025. As discussed during the interview, while the examiner maintained that the cited references disclosed various authentication methods under the broadest reasonable interpretation, applicant convinced the examiner that the references did not disclose different levels of access (e.g., "tiers") based on the different levels of authentication. Based on this discussion, applicant has amended claim 1 to recite "a first permitted range of use" and "a second permitted range of use" based on whether the user has executed the predetermined authentication. Additionally, applicant has cancelled claim 16 and added new claim 17 to further clarify the different card requirements for claim 5. Applicant submits that the claims are not rendered obvious by the cited references for the reasons set forth below.

Claim Objections:**

Claims 1, 14, and 15 previously included multiple references to "a plurality of user terminals" and "a service." As discussed during the interview, applicant has accepted the examiner's suggestion and amended these claims to read "the plurality of user terminals" and "the service" respectively.

Claim Rejections Under 35 U.S.C. ยง 103:**

Claims 1, 2, 4, 8 and 14-15 stand rejected as being unpatentable over Ren (US20180255059, hereinafter "Ren"), in view of Xuan et al. (US20190036923, hereinafter "Xuan"). Claims 3, 5, 6, and 13 stand rejected as being unpatentable over Ren in view of Xuan, and further in view of Eisen (US20170262845, hereinafter "Eisen"). Claim 7 stands rejected as being unpatentable over Ren in view of Xuan and Eisen, and further in view of Lang et al. (US20220138116, hereinafter "Lang"). Claims 9-11 stand rejected as being unpatentable over Ren in view of Xuan, and further in view of Fernandez-Spadaro et al. (US20210281572, hereinafter "Fernandez-Spadaro"). Claim 12 stands rejected as being unpatentable over Ren in view of Xuan, and further in view of Ruppin et al. (US20140053227, hereinafter "Ruppin").

Claim 1:**

Applicant respectfully submits that claim 1, as amended, is not rendered obvious by the examiner's cited references.

As discussed during the examiner interview, while the examiner maintained that the cited references disclosed various authentication methods under the broadest reasonable interpretation, applicant convinced the examiner that the references did not disclose different levels of access (e.g., "tiers") based on the different levels of authentication.

As amended, claim 1 now recites that the setting includes "a first permitted range of use when the predetermined authentication has not been executed and a second permitted range of use when the predetermined authentication has been executed." This amendment directly addresses the examiner's concerns and clarifies that different levels of access are provided based on the authentication status.

First, applicant submits that Xuan does not disclose "wherein the first authentication method and the second authentication method are different" where both authentication methods are "for each of a plurality of user terminals" and each requires separate user input.

The published application describes the predetermined authentication as an additional authentication step requiring user input that allows the user terminal to gain access to increased functionality. (See Figure 7, S110). As explained in paragraph [0061], the predetermined authentication is explicitly described as being "different from the authentication at login." Support for the amendments requiring separate user inputs can be found in paragraphs [0061], [0235], and Figure 7 of the published application.

To establish the "first authentication method", the examiner relies on Xuan, quoting "the application proxy service 126 can authenticate the structured request based on the access token transmitted with the structured request." (See paragraph [0051]). Applicant submits that this describes a technique for the system to authenticate a structured request as opposed to authenticating the user terminal in response to user input. Therefore, the cited reference does not disclose a "first authentication method" because it is not authentication "for each of a plurality of user terminals."

For the "second authentication method", the examiner states that "[t]he application proxy service 126 can identify a user account... from a device identifier associated with the client device." (See paragraph [0045]). However, the reference describes using the device identifier to identify the user as opposed to authenticate the user terminal, which is a different operation. 

The examiner subsequently references another section of Xuan to establish a "second authentication method": "[T]he application proxy service 126 can authenticate the user using an identity service." (See paragraph [0050]). While this may be an authentication, this is the first and only such authentication method disclosed. The execution of this authentication method provides the access token recited in the reference used to establish the "first authentication method" above. Therefore, what the examiner describes as two authentication methods is merely two parts of a single user terminal authentication method.

Further, the structured request authentication identified as the "first authentication method" occurs later in Xuan than either of the "second" authentication methods. That is, the structured request authentication only occurs after the token, which could be considered the second authentication, has been issued.

Most importantly, the cited references do not disclose different permitted ranges of use based on whether the predetermined authentication has been executed, which is now recited in amended claim 1.

Claim 2:**

Applicant respectfully submits that claim 2 is not rendered obvious by the examiner's cited references. As claim 2 depends from claim 1, please see the discussion of claim 1 above.

**Claims 3-4 and 6-16:**

As claims 3-4 and 6-16 either depend from or recite features similar to claim 1, please see the discussion of claim 1 above.

Claim 5:**

Applicant respectfully submits that claim 5 is not rendered obvious by the examiner's cited references. 

First, applicant submits that Eisen does not disclose "perform the setting for the second card for each of the plurality of user terminals based on whether the possession authentication for the first card has been executed from each of the plurality of user terminals."

Claim 5 relates to an embodiment from the published application wherein a user performing possession authentication with one card may access expanded functionality associated with a second card. "When the possession authentication is executed, the setting module 302 performs a second setting, which is a setting relating to a second card of the user associated with the first card." (See "[Setting Module]" section at paragraph [0130].)

In contrast, Eisen describes two transactions wherein a card used in the first transaction ("first card") is compared with a card used in the second transaction ("second card"). If a first magnetic fingerprint from the first card matches a second magnetic fingerprint from the second card, the transaction may be confirmed, whereas if the first magnetic fingerprint does not match the second magnetic fingerprint, "there may be a discrepancy." (Paragraph [0108]; see also paragraph [0041]). In the case that the fingerprints do not match, the transaction may be subjected to additional checks.

As the claim is directed to a setting that is performed for a second card when a user performs possession authentication with a first card, determining whether to approve a transaction when the same card (e.g., one with a matching magnetic fingerprint) is subsequently used as in Eisen does not disclose the feature. Otherwise stated, Eisen does not disclose changing a setting on a second card, because it is directed to confirming a same card is used for multiple transactions.

**New Claim 17:**

Applicant respectfully submits that new claim 17 is not rendered obvious by the examiner's cited references. 

As discussed during the interview, the examiner indicated that if claim 5 were amended to explicitly recite that the cards were different, the rejection would likely be overcome. Accordingly, applicant has cancelled claim 16 and added new claim 17 which explicitly recites that the first card is possessed "by the user," the second card is "previously" associated with the user identification information, and the setting is "a setting to increase access to the service."

This further distinguishes Eisen as it clarifies that there are two distinct cards associated with the user. Moreover, it also clarifies that the claimed setting increases access to the service in response to a successful possession authentication as compared with potentially decreased access to the service because of a failed possession authentication as described in Eisen.

Support for these amendments can be found, for example, in paragraphs [0130] and [0133] of the published application.

# Conclusion

In view of the foregoing amendments and remarks, Applicant respectfully requests the Examiner's reconsideration of this application, and the timely allowance of the pending claims.

As Applicant's remarks with respect to the Examiner's rejections are sufficient to overcome these rejections, Applicant's silence as to assertions by the Examiner in the Office Action or certain requirements that may be applicable to such assertions (e.g., whether a reference constitutes prior art, reasons to modify a reference and/or to combine references, assertions as to dependent claims, etc.) is not a concession by Applicant that such assertions are accurate or such requirements have been met, and Applicant reserves the right to analyze and dispute such assertions/requirements in the future.

If the Examiner believes that there are issues remaining to be resolved in this application, the Examiner is invited to contact the undersigned attorney at the telephone number indicated below to arrange for an interview to expedite and complete prosecution of this case.

If this paper is not timely filed, Applicant respectfully petitions for an appropriate extension of time. The fees for such an extension or any other fees that may be due with respect to this paper may be charged to Deposit Account No. 506039.
