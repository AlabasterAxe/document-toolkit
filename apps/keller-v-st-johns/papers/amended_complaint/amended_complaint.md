# STATEMENT OF FACTS
12. Plaintiff Matthew E. Keller is a student at St. John's University School of Law. (St. John's enrollment certificate attached hereto as Exhibit "A")
13. Upon information and belief, at all times hereinafter mentioned, St. John's has offered a student health insurance plan (SHIP). Students living on St. John's campuses are automatically enrolled in SHIP and have the option to waive if they have comparable insurance (hereinafter referred to as the "resident group"). Off-campus students may opt into SHIP. (hereinafter referred to as the "non-resident group") (A copy of the 2024-25 St. John's SHIP plan summary is attached hereto as Exhibit "B")
14. For the 2024-2025 academic year defendants offered SHIP to all registered undergraduate and graduate students actively taking classes with annual premiums of $3,942. (Exhibit "B", p. 2)
15. Plaintiff enrolled in St. John's SHIP program for the 2024-2025 academic year. (A copy of Plaintiff's receipt for enrolling in SHIP for the 2024-25 academic year is attached hereto as Exhibit "C")
16. For the 2025-2026 academic year, the defendants split the SHIP program offering the same benefits at different premiums for resident and non-resident students. Resident students have annual premiums of $3,544. (A copy of the 2025-26 St. John's SHIP plan summary is attached hereto as Exhibit "D") Non-resident students have annual premiums of $11,862. (Exhibit "D", p. 3) This is a difference of $8,318 between the premiums charged to resident students and non-resident students. This amounts to non-resident students paying 235% more than resident students.
17. On July 29th, 2025, Plaintiff enrolled in St. John's off-campus student health insurance plan at a cost of $11,862. (A copy of Plaintiff's receipt for enrolling in SHIP for the 2025-26 academic year is attached hereto as Exhibit "E")
18. Upon information and belief, the utilization of the median student between the resident group and non-resident group is not significantly different and the utilization of the non-resident group is mostly explained by a small number of outliers that have a utilization rate that is not characteristic of the group.
19. Upon information and belief, the decision to split the SHIP program was not the result of an actuarially justified risk classification.

# COUNT ONE
(Unfair Discrimination in Violation of NY CLS Ins. § 4224(b)(1))
(against all defendants)

20. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 through 19 as if fully set forth herein.
21. Given that the utilization rate of the median member of the resident group and non-resident group are not significantly different, the members of the non-resident group and the members of the resident group are members of a single class, defined by their eligibility to participate in St. John's SHIP Program. 
22. The tremendous increase and incredible disparity in premiums constitute unfair discrimination in premiums of members of the same class in violation of New York Insurance Law § 4224(b)(1).
23. Given that Plaintiff is a non-resident member of St. John's SHIP program, Plaintiff suffered harm from being denied access to SHIP at the same rate as resident students as a direct and proximate result of the defendants' unlawful discriminatory practices.

# COUNT TWO
(Unfair Discrimination in Violation of NY CLS Ins. § 4224(b)(1))
(against all defendants)

24. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 through 19 as if fully set forth herein.
25. Given that Defendant St. John's treated all students as a single class in the 2024-25 academic year and the decision to split the SHIP program was not actuarially justified, the members of the non-resident group and the members of the resident group are members of the same class as described in 4224(b)(1).
26. Given the tremendous increase and incredible disparity in premiums, the splitting of the single 2024-25 class into non-resident and resident groups constitutes unfair discrimination in premiums against non-resident members of the single 2024-25 class in violation of New York Insurance Law § 4224(b)(1).
27. Given that Plaintiff was a non-resident member of the single 2024-25 class, Plaintiff suffered harm from being denied access to SHIP at the same rate as resident students as a direct and proximate result of the defendants' unlawful discriminatory practices.

WHEREFORE, by reason of the foregoing, plaintiff Matthew E. Keller hereby respectfully requests the following relief:
a. A permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from charging different health insurance premiums to classes that are not actuarially justified.
b. Compensatory damages in the amount of $8,318 against Defendant.
c. Such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

# JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
