These documents are for service of process on the Department of State as an agent for the business named above (See https://dos.ny.gov/service-processnotice-claim for more info). The department of state requires two copies of the process documents which is why I have included the same file twice. I have included the department of state search page. You will have to fill out line 5 on the cover sheet of the document. The initial 3 documents will need to be stapled to the subsequent documents.
