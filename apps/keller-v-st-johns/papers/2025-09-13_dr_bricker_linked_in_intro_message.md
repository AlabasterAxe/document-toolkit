Hi Dr. Bricker, 

I'm reaching out because I found your YouTube Channel and I really enjoyed your videos.

I am a former professional software engineer/current law student. I'm experiencing an unfortunate situation with my student health insurance plan. My university recently made a change to separately rate on-campus/automatic enrollment students and off-campus/voluntary student health insurance plans. This meant that the plans went from ~$3,900 for everybody, to ~$3,500 for on-campus students and ~$11,800 for off-campus students. When comparing the off-campus plan to 25 nearby universities, the plan is 64% higher than the next most expensive plan and 3.7 standard deviations above the mean. On it's face, this seems like an unfair arrangement, in my opinion.

I'm trying to understand this change through an actuarial lens. I've read through the Actuarial Standards of Practice (12 and 25) but they seemed to establish standards at a pretty high-level and it's not quite the same as understanding the system from the inside. If you'd be available to chat, I'd love to have a video call to get your thoughts on this situation. I'm happy to pay you for your time.

Thanks!

Matt
