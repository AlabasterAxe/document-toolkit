Describe the pending court action:

I have brought an action, pro se seeking injunctive relief and compensatory damages against St. John's University and its insurance partners for violating 4224(b)(1).

There is an order to show cause for a temporary restraining order scheduled for September 11th, 2025.

Please enter the details of your complaint here:

For the 2025-2026 academic year, St. John's has started charging different premiums for on- and off-campus students. on-campus students are charged $3,544 and off-campus students are charged $11,862.

This is a difference of $8,318 between the premiums charged to resident students and non-resident students. This amounts to non-resident students paying 235% more than resident students.

The off-campus premium is an extreme outlier when comparing the premiums of 25 nearby universities. It is 3.7 standard deviations above the mean. This seems to indicate that the premium comes as a result of a small number of extremely high-utilization outliers as opposed to being a fair representation of the risk of a typical student in this group.

There are significant actuarial concerns with establishing this as a separate class, most notably adverse selection and credibility as set forth in ASOP No. 12.

This extreme price increase is putting the student health insurance plan out of reach for many students which in some circumstances is leading them to have to find new care teams which can be incredibly time intensive and have potential lapses in care.

Finally, this price increase, in addition to the fact that the plan is voluntary will invariably lead to an "adverse selection death spiral" which will cause off campus students to lose access to insurance through the school.

What would be a fair resolution to this issue?

An injunction against St. John's University and its insurance partners preventing them from charging different premiums between on-campus and off-campus students.
