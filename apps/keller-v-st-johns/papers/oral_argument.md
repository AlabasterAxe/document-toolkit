 - Matthew Keller, representing myself pro se

 - Issue: TRO enjoining St. John's and insurance partners from charging on-campus and off-campus students different premiums.

 - 4 reasons
     - prima facie absurd disparity between groups with no reason to believe that it should cost nearly 3.5 times as much to insure a student living off campus as one living on campus
     - adverse selection death spiral => irreparable harm
     - 10% increase vs. destruction of the plan => balance of equities
     - small enrollment period after which point the damage will have been done => imminent

 - Private Right of Action
     - Particulars of this case lend itself to a finding of a narrow implied private right of action
        - consistent with the legislative scheme
            - ex ante action to prevent harm
            - extreme disparity
            - irreparable harm
                - death spiral
        - Here, given the short time frame, and the requested relief the existing enforcement mechanism would not adequately support the relief sought so it makes sense for the court to find an implied private right.

 - CLS ยง 6301, likelihood of success on the merits, danger of irreparable harm, balance of equities
 - Under ยง 4224, insurers offering health insurance in NY are prevented from unfairly discriminating against members of the same class
 - On-campus (automatic), off-campus (opt-in), 2024: all rated together, 2025: rated separately, on campus: 3,544,  off-campus: 11,862
 - Indications of Unfair Discrimination:
    - 235% more for off-campus students
    - 64% more expensive than the next most expensive plan of 25 nearby universities
    - Potentially most damningly, Dr. Manzo, the administrator responsible for the decision, was unaware of whether the high premium came as a result of a small number of outliers.
    - 3.7 standard deviations higher than other plans
 - Irreparable Harm: "Adverse Selection Death Spiral" 
    - well understood phenomenon, which Dr. Manzo of the University's administration is familiar with
    - for a student that has complex medical issues, it can entail having to find a different care team.
 - Balance of Equities: 10% increase vs the destruction of the off-campus plan

 - Possible Arguments of Discussion
    - No Private Right of Action
        - Sheehy Test
            - (1) the plaintiff is one of the class for whose particular benefit the statute was enacted;
            - (2) recognition of a private right of action would promote the legislative purpose; and
            - (3) creation of such a right would be consistent with the legislative scheme.
        - Maimonides
            - Thus, recognition of a private right of action "would augment the existing enforcement devices and enhance a legislative scheme"
            
        - 
        

        - History of the law
        - Neither the Supreme nor Appellate courts in Friedman go into any detail about the application of Sparkes
        
        - Sparkes 
            - Not binding precedent
            - "particular benefit"
                - misreads Dornberger: the holding in dornberger is not that people with disabilities are not in the group for whose particular benefit, but rather that the people for whose particular benefit the statute was passed was any insureds or insurers who have been harmed by unfair discrimination. 
            - Enforcement Mechanism Sufficently Attenuated: 2011 Department of Insurance was absorbed by the Department of Financial Services, after which point, no further opinions were published regarding statutory interpretation.
        
        - Polan
            - The holding in Polan only applies to 4224(b)(2)
            - also suffers from the same problem.

    - Filed Rate Doctrine
        - 3240 (i) "Every insurer or corporation shall report to the superintendent annually [and] demonstrate the insurer's or corporation's compliance with the applicable rules and regulations."
        - Needs Factual Determination
    - Not required to offer it to all students.
