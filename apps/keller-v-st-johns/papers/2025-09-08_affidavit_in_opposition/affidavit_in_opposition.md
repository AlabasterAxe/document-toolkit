Matthew E. Keller, does hereby affirm under the penalties of perjury pursuant to CPLR ยง 2106 as follows:

I am the plaintiff in the above-captioned action and I am representing myself pro se in this matter. I have personal knowledge of the facts and circumstances set forth herein.

I make this Affidavit in opposition to St. John's University's motion by Order to Show Cause seeking adjournment of my Order to Show Cause and Hearing currently scheduled for September 11, 2025, at 2:00 p.m.

The emergency injunctive relief requested in my Order to Show Cause is the primary goal of this action, and the deadline to enroll in the student health insurance plan is September 18, 2025. Any delay in the proceedings would likely deprive me of the relief to which I may be entitled, as the enrollment deadline would pass before I could obtain a court ruling on my emergency application.

Defendant St. John's University has had ample notice of this matter and the issues raised herein. On July 14, 2025, I sent a detailed Statement of Concerns (attached hereto as Exhibit A) to St. John's Administration specifically notifying them that they may be in violation of Insurance Law ยง 4224(b)(1). This communication put them on clear notice of my concerns regarding their insurance practices and the potential legal issues.

On August 1, 2025, I formally notified St. John's University of my intent to file a complaint in this matter, providing them with additional advance notice of these proceedings. This further notification gave them sufficient time to prepare their response to these allegations.

As to all other defendants, I have fully complied with the service requirements set forth by the court, and any issues regarding service should not warrant delaying the emergency relief sought against the primary defendant, St. John's University.

I acknowledge that there is no express private right of action under Insurance Law ยง 4224(b)(1) and that the legislative scheme initially envisioned enforcement primarily by the Department of Financial Services. However, New York law recognizes that an implied private right of action may exist under appropriate circumstances.

The Court of Appeals has established the three-part test set forth in Sheehy v. Big Flats Community Day, Inc., 73 N.Y.2d 629 (1989), for determining when an implied private right of action exists:

(1) the plaintiff is one of the class for whose particular benefit the statute was enacted;

(2) recognition of a private right of action would promote the legislative purpose; and

(3) creation of such a right would be consistent with the legislative scheme.

**Particular Benefit:** The text of Insurance Law ยง 4224(b)(1) was enacted for the particular benefit of insured persons like myself. The statute specifically prohibits discrimination in insurance coverage based on various protected characteristics, and I fall squarely within the class of individuals the statute was designed to protect.

**Promote Legislative Purpose:** Recognition of a private right of action in this case would directly promote the legislative purpose of preventing discrimination in insurance practices. Allowing individuals to bring actions to prevent and remedy discrimination ensures that the statute's protections are meaningful and enforceable, particularly in situations requiring immediate relief.

**Consistent with Legislative Scheme:** While I acknowledge that the Department of Financial Services has primary enforcement authority, the existence of a private right of action can harmonize with the legislative intent under specific circumstances. As demonstrated in Maimonides Med. Ctr. v. Reliance Ins. Co., 10 A.D.3d 404 (1st Dep't 2004), the existence of a private right of action is fact-dependent and may be appropriate when the existing enforcement scheme could not provide the relief requested.

Here, I am requesting emergency injunctive relief which the existing enforcement mechanism would not be equipped to provide within the time constraints imposed by the September 18, 2025 enrollment deadline. The Department of Financial Services cannot issue emergency injunctive relief to ensure my immediate enrollment in compliant insurance coverage.

Accordingly, I contend that the Court should find a narrow private right of action exists in cases such as this, where emergency relief is necessary to prevent irreparable harm and the administrative enforcement mechanism cannot provide timely relief.

The defendants' request for adjournment would cause substantial and irreparable prejudice to my rights. The September 18, 2025 enrollment deadline is fixed and immutable. If this Court does not rule on my emergency application before that date, I will be forced to either: (1) accept discriminatory insurance coverage that violates state law, or (2) forgo insurance coverage entirely and face significant financial risk.

St. John's University's claim that witnesses are unavailable due to vacation schedules rings hollow given the extensive advance notice they received of these issues dating back to July 14, 2025. They have had nearly two months to prepare their response and gather necessary witness statements.

WHEREFORE, I respectfully request that this Court deny defendants' motion for adjournment and proceed with the scheduled hearing on September 11, 2025, at 2:00 p.m., so that I may obtain the emergency relief necessary to protect my rights before the September 18, 2025 enrollment deadline passes.
