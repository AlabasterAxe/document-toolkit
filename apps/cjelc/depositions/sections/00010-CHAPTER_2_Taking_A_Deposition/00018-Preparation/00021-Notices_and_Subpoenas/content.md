Your deposition will not take place unless you issue proper notice to obtain the attendance of the witness and to alert opposing counsel. The notice rules are described in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(b) and in Chapter 9 of this book. Make sure you follow them. A notice goes to every party in the litigation. ^10

If the deponent is not a party to the lawsuit, make sure you also subpoena the witness. The rules for subpoenas are described in Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 45(a) and (b) and in Chapter 9. If you issue a subpoena that calls for production of documents from the witness, be sure to attach a copy of the document production description to the notice that you have served on the parties, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(b).


^10 Throughout this handbook, we will be referring to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Be aware that not all states use the same rules, and even states that use the federal rules as a model may adopt their own unique variations of the federal rules. Moreover, even federal courts have various local rules and practices. Find out what they are or risk serious consequences.
