There are a number of logistical details you need to arrange when you take a deposition:

- Arrange for the court reporter. The deposition cannot proceed if you neglect to arrange for the attendance of a court reporter. ^11
- Reserve the conference room. You need a distraction-free space in which to take the deposition. The space needs to be big enough to accommodate all of the people who will be attending. In some cases, that will be you, one opposing lawyer, the witness, and the court reporter. In others, it will be you, an army of other lawyers, the witness, the witness's boss, party representatives, and the court reporter. In still others, it will be you, one opposing lawyer, the witness, the court reporter, and a videographer whose equipment takes up more room than the people do. Be especially cautious about reserving an appropriately sized and configured room if the deposition is taking place out of town and consequently out of your office.
- Arrange for the videographer. If you are going to videotape the deposition, you need to reserve a videographer. This person may be employed by an entirely different company than the court reporter, and requires his or her own separate reservation.
- Arrange for sufficient copies of deposition exhibits. Select in advance a universe of documents that you may show the witness as possible exhibits. You need copies for the court reporter to mark as the official exhibits. You need duplicate clean copies for the other lawyers (at least one set for each party). You need annotated copies for yourself to use in questioning the witness. Organize these copies so they are readily at hand.
- Arrange for refreshments. It is customary and helpful to have at least water, coffee, and soft drinks at depositions. Mouths get dry. Energy levels fail.

- Arrange for lunches. Time tables may be tight. You and the other attendees may want to have lunch brought in to the deposition, take a short break, and resume. Think about that in advance.
- Arrange for travel. If a deposition is out of town, this may mean air tickets, hotel reservations, and rental cars. It also may mean advance shipment to the deposition site of all of those duplicate copies of exhibits that you otherwise will be hauling on the airplane. Think about all of this in advance. Double check everything to make sure people and documents arrive in the right place at the right time.
- Arrange for supplies: legal pads, pens, highlighters, stickers to tab documents or notes.

These are all obvious, you say. Yes and no. In calm, quiet moments they are obvious. In the press of day-to-day legal practice, they can be easy to forget. Here is a checklist. Use it for each deposition.
