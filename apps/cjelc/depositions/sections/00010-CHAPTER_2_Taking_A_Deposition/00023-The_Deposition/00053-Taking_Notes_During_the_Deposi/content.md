The most important thing to do when taking a deposition is to listen. You will miss critical follow through unless you pay careful attention to all aspects of each of the deponent's answers. Paying such careful attention to each word the deponent utters can be hard to do if you simultaneously are trying to take copious notes. One way to solve this problem is to ask a legal assistant or another lawyer to attend the deposition for the purpose of note-taking. This approach, however, increases the cost to the client.

An alternative is to go into the deposition with an outline of question topics on the left half of a page, leaving room on the right half, opposite the questions, for recording key notes about answers. This device will help you know that you have covered particular points, and will help you refresh your recollection of the deponent's prior testimony if you have to return to a topic during a deposition. It also will provide a device for jotting a quick word or two about areas to follow through on.
