When you start a deposition, find out who the witness is. If the witness is friendly, you may want to personalize the witness to strengthen credibility. Yet there may be situations in which you do not want to seem particularly friendly, even if the witness is Will Rogers. If the witness is hostile, you still want to know the kind of person with whom you are dealing. If you find something in common, it may help create some rapport that reduces the hostility. The background examination need not be long, but find out some basics.

A: Amanda Sarah Jones.

A: 123 Main St., Capital City, State of Moot.

Even from this short exchange, you have a definite impression of this witness. She has a stable background, does not move around a lot, is welleducated, and presumably likes analyzing problems and working with teenagers.

In some situations, background information can turn out to be especially important. Do not simply ask background questions by rote. Consider how a deponent's background relates to the case. For example, if a case involves financial records, ask about the deponent's college business and accounting courses. If a case involves advertising practices, ask about the deponent's marketing training. If a case involves a real estate sale, ask about the deponent's own experience in buying and selling homes. You might find out important substantive information or you might identify a bias.
