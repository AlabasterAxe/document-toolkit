It is advisable to ask a deponent what he or she did to prepare for the deposition. In general, the one area of preparation that is off-limits is the substance of conversations between the deponent and his or her counsel. A line of questioning might proceed as follows:

Example: Q: Ms. Grandma, did you do anything to prepare for your deposition?
A: Yes.
Q: What did you do?
A: I searched for documents in response to your subpoena.
Q: Did you find some?
A: Yes.
Q: And those are the documents we marked as Exhibit 2?
A: Yes.
Q: Did you do anything else?
A: I told Little Red Riding Hood I was coming here today.
Q: What did you say?
A: I said I was being deposed, and asked her if she had any advice.
Q: What did she say?
A: She said I should just tell you everything that happened.
Q: Anything else?
A: No.
Q: Did you talk to anyone else?
A: Yes.
| Q: | Who? |
| :-- | :-- |
| A: | My lawyer. |
| Q: | Is that Ms. Anderson, who is here with you |
| | today? |
| A: | Yes. |
| Q: | What did you say to Ms. Anderson? |
| A: | [By Ms. Anderson:] Objection, privileged |
| | and work product. I instruct the witness not |
| | to answer. |
| Q: | Did you talk to anyone else? |
| A: | No. |
| Q: | Did you review any documents in |
| | preparation for the deposition? |
| A: | No. |

This last question raises a potential legal issue. Suppose the deponent had said yes, and you had then asked to see the documents. Is such a request similar to a request for the substance of conversations between a deponent and her counsel, and thus an invasion of attorney-client privilege or work product protections? Alternatively, is the request perfectly fair because presumably the documents refreshed the witness's recollection of prior events? The answer requires attention to both Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(3) and Federal Rule of Evidence 612 .

Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(3), a party may obtain documents prepared in anticipation of litigation only upon a showing of substantial need. Many attorneys would argue that an attorney's selection of documents to show a witness in preparation for a deposition implicitly reveals what the attorney thinks about the lawsuit or the approach the attorney plans to take. Rule 26, the argument goes, protects against the required disclosure of particular documents used by the defending lawyer to prepare the deponent for the deposition. An attorney propounding this view will instruct a witness not to answer any questions identifying which documents the attorney showed to the witness in preparation for the deposition. ^13

Rule 26 logic, however, should be balanced against Federal Rule of Evidence 612. This rule of evidence provides that an adverse party is entitled to inspect any "writing" that a witness uses to "refresh memory for the purpose of testifying" in a civil case. Many attorneys would say that Rule 612 trumps Rule 26 if a witness concedes that a document reviewed for a deposition helped refresh the witness's memory about a particular event. ^14

One way for you as the questioning attorney to improve your chances of seeing the documents is to use the following series of questions:

| Example: | Q: | Ms. Grandma, did you review any <br> documents in preparation for this <br> deposition? <br> Yes. <br> Have those documents refreshed your <br> memory about subjects we are discussing? <br> Yes. <br> Have you used those documents to help you <br> testify? |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |

A: Yes.
Q: May I see them, please?
The two middle questions that set up memory refreshment for the purpose of testifying should help you trump an attorney work product objection. If the witness will not give you yes answers to the middle questions as to all the documents, then just ask about document review in connection with each deposition subject as you get to it. You might get the necessary concessions as to some documents, even if you cannot get the concessions as to the entire document preparation universe.


^13 Note, however, there is a threshold question as whether Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(3) even applies. Unless the documents reviewed by the witness were themselves prepared in anticipation of the litigation, the questioning lawyer might argue that Rule 26(b)(3) is not applicable.
^14 See e.g., Sporck v. Peil, 759 F.2d 312, 318 (3d Cir. 1985) (detailing discussion on this debate and ultimately holding that counsel's selection of documents in preparation for a deposition is protected by the work-product doctrine in a case where "deposing counsel failed to lay a proper foundation under Rule 612 for production of the documents selected by counsel"); cf. F.D.I.C. v. Wachovia Ins. Servs., Inc., 241 F.R.D. 104, 107 (D. Conn. 2007) (interpreting the "Sporck exception" narrowly). Some courts have been openly critical of Sporck and have declined to apply it or have distinguished it. See, e.g., In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., 859 F.2d 1007, 1018 (1st Cir. 1988); In re Pradaxa Prods. Liab. Litig., MDL No. 2385, 2013 WL 1776433, at *1 (S.D. Ill. Apr. 25, 2013) (attorney entitled to know which documents a witness reviewed prior to a deposition, but not entitled to know which of those documents were selected by counsel; counsel may not, however, "manufacture a zone of privacy by gratuitously disclosing" that all documents have been selected by counsel); but see Stevens v. Corelogic, Inc., No. 14cv1158, 2016 WL 397936, at *9-10 (S.D. Cal. Feb. 1, 2016) (declining to follow In re Pradaxa; attorney selection of documents in preparation for deposition is protected work product, although a witness's independent selection of documents is not protected). For a helpful and fairly comprehensive discussion of the intersection of the work-product doctrine and Federal Rule of Evidence 612, see In re Xarelto Prods. Liab. Litig., 314 F.R.D. 397 (E.D. La. 2016) (ultimately holding in a case involving over three million documents that "a list of documents reviewed by a witness in preparation for a deposition is discoverable under Rule 26(b), because the list is relevant, proportional to the needs of the case, and not privileged").
