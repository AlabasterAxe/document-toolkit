In virtually all depositions, you will want to ask the journalist's classic five " w " questions: who, what, where, when, and why? We add: how? These six words will be useful in many different settings.

Example: Q: All right, Mr. Wolf. Where did you go on the morning of the fifth?
A: To Grandma's house.
Q: When did you go there?
A: About 10:00 in the morning.
Q: How did you get there?
A: I walked.
Q: What route did you take?
A: The high road through the woods.
Q: What were you planning to do when you arrived?
A: Eat someone.
Q: Who?
A: Little Red Riding Hood.
Q: Why?
A: Because I am a wolf, and that's what wolves do.

The series of six "w/h" questions should be a fixture in your repertoire. Every time you encounter a document, a meeting, a conversation, or an event, you should ask these questions automatically, unless you have a special reason not to do so.

# [Repeat as to second and third meeting.] 

The who, what, where, when, why, and how questions accomplish at least three purposes. First, remember that you ultimately will be telling a story. Good story tellers always weave in some details; in the end, the details make the story more interesting and colorful for the audience. Second, the six questions help test the deponent's credibility. Do the details of the story hang together? Third, the questions help establish an evidentiary foundation for the admissibility (in the case of helpful facts) or the inadmissibility (in the case of unhelpful facts) of the witness's testimony.

Examples: Q: Tell me about the meeting, Ms. Jones. Who participated?
A: All the conspirators.

A: Mr. Smith, Ms. Crawler, and me.

A: In a smoke-filled room in my house.

A: The night of April 6.
Q: What time?
A: 1:00 a.m.
Q: What did you say at the meeting?
A: I said, "Let's rob the bank."
Q: Did Ms. Crawler say anything in response?
A: Yes.
Q: What did Ms. Crawler say?
A: She said, "Good idea."
Q: Did Mr. Smith say anything?
A: Yes.
Q: What did he say?
A: He said, "I agree."
Q: Why did you want to rob the bank?
A: I just lost a lot of money in technology stocks.
Q: Now, Ms. Jones, you say you had a conversation about robbing a bank?
A: Yes.
Q: Let's explore that in more detail. Who participated?
A: I don't know their names.
