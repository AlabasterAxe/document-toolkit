It is absolutely permissible to ask deponents for hearsay, speculation, and opinions. ^16 Hearsay will not be admissible at trial, unless an evidentiary exception exists. Speculation will not be admissible. Some forms of opinion will not be admissible either. But that does not mean you have to avoid asking for these kinds of information at the deposition. If challenged, simply explain that the information you seek need not be admissible to be discoverable, and may in fact lead to admissible evidence later. The deponent, for example, may testify that she knows some information because Mr. X told her this. You may then want to talk to or depose Mr. X regarding the source of his knowledge.

This, by the way, is why it is flatly impermissible for lawyers to instruct witnesses during pre-deposition preparation to say, "I don't know," in response to questions merely because they call for hearsay.

Example: Q: Ms. Grandma, why did Mr. Wolf come to your home on the morning of the 5th?
A: I don't know. [So far, this could be a truthful and permissible answer; Ms. Grandma is not Mr. Wolf, and does not know what he was truly thinking.]
Q: Did Mr. Wolf ever tell you why he came to your home that morning?
A: Yes.
Q: When did he tell you?
A: That morning.
Q: Where were you at the time?
A: In my living room at my house.
Q: Was the conversation face-to-face?
A: Yes.
Q: Was anyone else present besides you and Mr. Wolf?
A: No.
Q: Who started the conversation?
A: I did.
Q: What did you say?
A: I asked Mr. Wolf why he had come to my home.
Q: What did Mr. Wolf say to you?
A: Objection, calls for hearsay. [This is a theoretically permissible, but unnecessary substantive objection by Mr. Wolf's lawyer.
Hearsay objections are typically preserved until trial. Moreover, the objection will eventually be overruled on the merits as Mr. Wolf is a party to the case.] Q: You may answer the question.
A: He said that he had come to eat Little Red Riding Hood.

In the above sequence, if the lawyer for Ms. Grandma had instructed Ms. Grandma not to answer the question about what Mr. Wolf had told her, the instruction would have been inappropriate. ^17 Furthermore, if Ms. Grandma, acting on instructions from her lawyer to testify only to what she knows firsthand and not to speculate, had answered all questions with "I don't know," she would have been committing perjury. The question, "why did he come?", which may call for speculation, is not the same thing as the question, "were you told?", which calls for a fact.


^16 The standard, remember, is that: "Parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party's claim or defense. . . . Information . . . need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable." FED. R. CIV. P. 26(b)(1) (emphasis added).
