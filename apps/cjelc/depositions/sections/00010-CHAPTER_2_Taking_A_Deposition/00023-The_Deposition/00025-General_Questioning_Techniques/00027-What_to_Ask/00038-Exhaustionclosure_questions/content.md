Especially in the case of a deposition of a neutral or hostile witness whom you are deposing for discovery purposes, you need to make sure you have exhausted the witness's knowledge on any given topic. Do not assume that a witness has told you everything; a properly prepared witness will not volunteer knowledge.

There is no magic formula for closure on each subject. Different lawyers use different forms. But they all resemble the following:

Examples: Q: Did anything else happen?
Q: Did he say anything else?
Q: Did you observe anything else? ^18
Q: Have you told me everything you remember about . . .?

# Q: Anything else? <br> Q: Is that everything? 

Keep asking the same exhaustion or closure question until you get a firm "no" to the "anything else" inquiry or a firm "yes" to the "everything" inquiry. Do not stop until that occurs. Ask similar closure questions after each break and at the end of the deposition.

Example: Ms. Grandma, did you have a chance during the break to think about your testimony from this morning? [Yes.] Is there any answer you would like to supplement or change now that you have had a chance to think about it?

These closure and exhaustion questions will show that you gave the deponent every opportunity to be as accurate as possible, thereby making it doubly difficult for the witness to modify or contradict answers later.
