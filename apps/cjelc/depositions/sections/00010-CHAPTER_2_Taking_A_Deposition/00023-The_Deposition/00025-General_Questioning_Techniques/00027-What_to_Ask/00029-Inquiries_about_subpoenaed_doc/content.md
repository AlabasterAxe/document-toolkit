If your subpoena included a request for documents, that should be an early area of inquiry. Some lawyers will handle this in advance of the actual deposition by agreeing with the deponent or the deponent's lawyer, if the witness is represented by counsel, that the witness's documents will be produced for inspection a day or two before the deposition starts. Advance production of the documents will make the whole deposition more efficient, which is to everyone's advantage. (It clearly is to your advantage as the lawyer taking the deposition. It also, frankly, is to the advantage of the defending lawyer. Although the defending attorney might think that the less efficient the deposition is the less the questioning attorney will accomplish, the defender also must take into account the value of the witness's time. The vice president of the defending lawyer's client will not take kindly to hearing from the questioning lawyer that the seven hour deposition could have taken only three if the defending lawyer had simply produced subpoenaed files in advance of the deposition, as requested.)

If advance production of documents cannot be arranged, an alternative is to bring a second lawyer or a legal assistant familiar with the lawsuit to the deposition to inspect the witness's document production and to cull out possible deposition exhibits, while the lead questioner proceeds on matters to which the documents do not necessarily relate. If attendance of a second lawyer or a legal assistant is not feasible, yet another alternative is to inspect the documents over a break or lunch.

In any event, always question the deponent near the outset of the deposition about the scope of the witness's search for documents:

| Example: | Q: | Ms. Jones, you are testifying today in response to a subpoena? |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| | A: | Yes. |
| | Q: | Is Exhibit 1 a copy of the subpoena? |
| | A: | Yes. |
| | Q: | The subpoena asked you to bring with you to the deposition all of your telephone bills for the year 1999? |
| | A: | Yes. |
| | Q: | Did you do that? |
| | A: | Yes. |
| | Q: | Are these all of the bills? |
| | A: | Yes. |
| | Q: | Are any missing? |
| | A: | No. |
| | Q: | How do you know that? |
| | A: | I did a search of my accounts payable file, and found the invoice for each month in 1999. |
| | Q: | Is each page a separate bill? |
| | A: | Yes. |
| | Q: | There are twelve pages in total? |
| | A: | Yes. |
| | Q: | Let's mark these pages collectively as Exhibit 2. [The court reporter affixes an Exhibit 2 sticker to the stapled document.] Showing you Exhibit 2, do you recognize it? |
| | A: | Yes. |
| | Q: | What is it? |
A: It's a collection of my telephone bills for 1999.
[Note: If the deponent gives you a troubling no or yes answer in the sequence, then pause and explore that answer.]
