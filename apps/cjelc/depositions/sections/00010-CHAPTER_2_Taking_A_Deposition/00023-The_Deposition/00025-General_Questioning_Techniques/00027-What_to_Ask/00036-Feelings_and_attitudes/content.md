Deponents are people too. They have feelings and attitudes, just as do other people. These attitudes and feelings can affect their perceptions and motives, and thus their testimony.
Example: Q: Mr. Deponent, you just gave us an unusually detailed description of the car accident scene for a bystander. You must have been concentrating hard?
A: Yes, I made a point of that.
Q. Why did you do that?
A: I wanted to make sure Ms. Smith sued Mr. Anderson for everything he had.
Q: Why?
A: I was in a car accident two years ago, and never got a dime out of it.
Q: How do you feel about that?
A: Really angry.
Feelings and attitudes may not always be relevant, and you may not always want to explore them for fear of looking like you are unfairly prying into the deponent's personal life. But think beyond the objective facts of the lawsuit in deciding what to ask each deponent. Bias caused by feelings and attitudes could reduce a deponent's credibility. And you want to know how strong those feelings and attitudes are, to gauge how the witness will appear to the judge and jury, and to determine whether you will be able to establish bias at trial.

Probing into feelings and attitudes also may help you establish inconsistencies when the witness talks about conduct. For example, assume that a deponent testifies that a defendant's conduct left the department an emotional wreck. Yet, when you ask the deponent later about events that occurred on the day in question, the deponent talks about partying all night with friends. The story does not fit together.
