Basically, every question you ask a witness falls into one or more of three categories. The first category is competency:foundation. Does the witness know anything relevant to the lawsuit, and can the witness recall and recount that information? The second category is credibility/bias. Can the witness be trusted when the witness claims to know something and to recall/recount that information? Finally, what is the substance of what the witness knows?

All of the questions below, and any other questions you may develop, fit one of the above categories. So a helpful cross-check in creating a witness outline is to ask yourself periodically: Does the outline cover each of these categories? If not, have you left out a category by accident or by design?
