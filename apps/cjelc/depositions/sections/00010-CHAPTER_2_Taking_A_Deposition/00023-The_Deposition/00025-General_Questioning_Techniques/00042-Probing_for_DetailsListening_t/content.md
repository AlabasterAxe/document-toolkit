Always plan on asking follow up questions. You want details. If the witness is friendly, you want details because it helps the deponent tell a persuasive story. If the witness is hostile, you want details (often, but not necessarily always) to test credibility and to avoid later surprise. Think of your "who, what, where, when, why, and how" sequence.

Part of probing for details, however, is not just remembering to ask questions like "who, what, where, when, why, and how." In addition, it is developing the habit of actually listening to the witness. This is harder than it sounds. If you are prepared properly, you have gone into the deposition with a plan for what you want out of it. You have specific points you want to prove and to disprove. But you cannot always predict all of the points that may come up with a given witness, especially one who is not in your control. So a witness may tender a promising line of testimony you did not anticipate. If you are not listening to the witness, but instead concentrating solely on your own planned questions, you may miss the opportunity to probe for important detail. To ask most effectively for details or to pick up on a promising line of questioning, you have to be paying attention to the actual previous answers in a sequence.

Example: Q: Mr. Wolf, what is your age?
A: Now, or at the time I tried to eat Little Red Riding Hood?
Q: Now.
A: 26 .
Q: How much education do you have?
Another part of probing for details is developing the habit of watching a deponent's demeanor. Witnesses send clues about their testimony through facial expressions, posture, pauses, vocal volume, and the like. These signals are important. Watch for them.
