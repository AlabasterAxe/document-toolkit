There will be times during the deposition when one of the other lawyers in the room will object to a question you ask. Let's say the objection is that your question is ambiguous. You are now put to a choice: do you reframe the question or insist on an answer to the one you asked?

There is no one correct approach to this choice. If it is obvious to you upon quick reflection that your original question to the witness is seriously ambiguous, then reframe it. Otherwise, we advise in most circumstances that you insist on an answer to your question as asked. After you get an answer to your original question, you may want to rephrase and restate it to make sure the record is clear. The logic behind this approach is that you do not want to encourage the other lawyers in the room to believe they can dictate the content of your questions merely by routinely objecting to form and causing you automatically to withdraw your initial inquiry.

On the other hand, do not be so proud as to refuse ever to reframe a question, and then watch a valuable answer be excluded from evidence because an objection to the question is sustained. This leads to an important exception to our general advice: if the primary purpose of the deposition is to preserve testimony, you need to be cautious about objections. In the deposition, you can require the witness to answer your question as framed; at trial, that answer may be excluded if the objection was well-founded.

Occasionally, it will be the witness who challenges your question: "What do you mean by . . . ?" If you sense that the witness truly is confused, rephrase the question. If, on the other hand, the witness seems to be attempting to assert some control over the deposition, you may try responding with a couple of different approaches. One is: "What do you not understand?" The other is: "What did you mean by [X] when you said it yourself ten minutes ago?"
