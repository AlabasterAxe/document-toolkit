Now you are ready to move on to substantive questioning. When you do, think back to your case blueprint and witness charts. What kind of witness are you facing? Is this a friendly witness - one who generally is aligned with your client's position in the case? Is this a neutral witness - for example, a bystander who happened to witness some event? Or is this a hostile witness - one who generally is aligned with your adversary's position in the case?

The type of witness you are facing affects your technique and approach to the deposition. Do you want the witness on a long leash or a short one? Do you want a conversation or a cross-examination? Will your own demeanor be relaxed or confrontational? Will you be content with general answers, or will you want to explore details extensively? Are you taking this deposition primarily to discover all kinds of facts, both good and bad, or primarily to preserve good facts in admissible form for trial?

In all likelihood, you will need to use some combination of techniques. For example, even though the deposition may be for fact exploration, you may want to use techniques that give you greater control over where the deponent's answers are heading in the case of a hostile witness than in the case of a friendly one. The point is: make a conscious decision about techniques. Go in with a plan.


^12 Reasonable lawyers may omit one or more of these introductory steps (except swearing in the witness) from time to time and instead launch immediately into substantive questions to catch the witness cold. Even then, these lawyers may go through this list with the witness a little later in the deposition.
