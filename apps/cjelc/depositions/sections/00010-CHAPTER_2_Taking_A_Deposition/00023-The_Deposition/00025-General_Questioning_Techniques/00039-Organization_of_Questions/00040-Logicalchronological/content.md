There are two basic styles of deposition question organization. The first is to put questions in a sequence that flows in a predictable manner, such as by logical subjects or by chronology.

Examples: Q: Good morning, Ms. Jones. Today, we are going to be talking about the accident, the nature of your injuries, and your medical expenses. Let's start with the accident. [Discussion of accident.] Now let's talk about your injuries. [Etc.]

Q: Good morning, Dr. Smith. Today, we are going to talk about your operating procedures. What is the first thing you do when you walk into the operating room?
[Discussion of first thing.] Then what do you do? [Discussion of second thing.] What next? [Etc.]

These kinds of approaches help an examination proceed in a way that is easy for a judge or jury to follow. Moreover, these approaches help the deponent stay on track with a coherent story. They are especially helpful when you are deposing a friendly or neutral witness through whom you are developing easily understood explanations of events. This approach to questioning also is advisable if you are taking the deposition to preserve testimony for trial.
