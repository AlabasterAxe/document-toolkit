There is a downside to the logical/chronological approach, of course. Precisely because the deponent can predict where you are going next, the deponent is less easily trapped with inconsistencies in a story. For that reason, lawyers may prefer a more unpredictable approach with hostile witnesses. With this approach, the questioning lawyer jumps around among subjects, and comes back to a given subject multiple times.

Example: Q:  Please state your name for the record.
A: Wilbur H. Wolf.
Q: What is your address?
A: 225 Carnivore Lane, Capital City.
Q: Mr. Wolf, on the morning of the fifth, you tried to eat Little Red Riding Hood, didn't you?
A: No.
Q: You were planning to eat her, true?
A: No.
Q: What did you do when you first awoke on the 5th, Mr. Wolf? [Discussion of early morning tasks]
Q: Mr. Wolf, let me show you Exhibit 6. It's an email you wrote to Mrs. Wolf on the morning of the 4th?
A: Yes.
# Q: It says you are going to eat Little Red Riding Hood, doesn't it? [Etc.] 

The point of the unpredictable approach is to keep the witness off balance. Be careful, however, that the approach does not also keep you off balance and cause you to lose track of the proceedings and forget to cover key points. Being unpredictable does not mean being disorganized yourself.

Some attorneys like to save the "critical," tough questions for witnesses until near the end and late in the day when witnesses are more likely to be fatigued and just want to get the deposition completed. Witnesses are often less guarded and alert at this time and their answers are often shorter and cleaner.
