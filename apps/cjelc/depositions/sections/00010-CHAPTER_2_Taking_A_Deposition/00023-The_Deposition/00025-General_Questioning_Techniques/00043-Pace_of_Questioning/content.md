Vary your pace to fit your purpose. Try to develop a rhythm. If you are trying to pin the witness down and the questioning is going well, use short, quick questions, and try to entice the witness to keep up with you through short, quick answers. Then perhaps turn to a longer question for a mini-summary of the favorable testimony before proceeding to the next topic.

Example: Q: On the night of the first, Ms. Jones, was it dark?
A: Yes.
Q: Was it raining?
A: Yes.
Q: Were there clouds?
A: Yes.
Q: Was the moon out?
A: No.
Q: Were you wearing your glasses?
A: No.
Q: Do you usually?
A: Yes.
Q: So it was a dark, rainy, cloudy, moonless, glass-less night when you were driving 40 miles per hour in a 30 mile per hour zone?

On the other hand, if the testimony is not going well, there is no benefit to you in letting the witness go on a roll of harmful answers. Slow the questions down. Take the witness out of rhythm.
Your pace and rhythm will be different if you are trying to draw a witness out and discover all aspects of the witness's story or sources of information. In this case, you will proceed more slowly and pause between the witness's answer and your next question. The slower pace and the pauses are more likely to create an atmosphere that will cause the witness to be more talkative and provide longer answers.

Example: Q: Ms. Witness, you say you didn't agree with your performance appraisal?
A: That's right.
Q: Can you please explain why?
A: [Some explanation provided.]
Q: [pause]
A: [Additional explanation provided.]
Q: Is there any other reason why you didn't agree with your performance appraisal?
A: Not that I can think of.
Q: [pause] Did you make any notes anywhere about your disagreement with the appraisal?
A:
Q: Did you talk to your supervisor about your disagreement?
A:
Q: Did you talk to anyone else at XYZ Co. about your disagreement?
A:
Q: Did you talk to anyone outside XYZ Co. about your disagreement?
A:
Q: Are you confident now that you have explained fully all bases for your disagreement with the performance appraisal?
A: Yes.
