One useful technique for questioners at the end of a sequence is to summarize the witness's testimony, and ask him or her to agree to the summary. Then the summary and answer are introduced into evidence for summary judgment or at trial.

## Example: So Mr. Smith, your testimony is that on the night of the accident you attended a party at which you had

six beers and three vodka martinis in the space of three hours, and ate no food, is that right?

If the witness agrees your summary is correct, then move on to the next line of questions. If the witness disagrees, then ask the witness, "Which part of my summary is not accurate?" You may use further questions to probe the alleged inaccuracy.

There are times, however, when this technique may be counterproductive. For example, if you have a potentially hostile witness whose guard is down and who consequently is giving you good information without fully realizing the impact of what he is doing, you may be better off taking the answers as they come and leaving it at that. If you restate or summarize the testimony, that may cause the witness to try to qualify those previous responses and to become more cautious and less expansive. Use your judgment.
