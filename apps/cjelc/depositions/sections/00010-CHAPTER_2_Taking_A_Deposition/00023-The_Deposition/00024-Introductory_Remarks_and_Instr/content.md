When you start a deposition, you should do at least the following:
First, have the court reporter swear in the witness. This will typically occur off the record, and then the court reporter will type at the start of the transcript that the witness has been duly sworn.

## Example: Ms. Court Reporter, would you please swear in the witness?

Second, introduce who you are, and tell the deponent the name of the party you represent.

Example: Good morning, Ms. Jones. We are here today to take your deposition in the Pardon v. ABC Railroad case. I am John McGreedy, the lawyer for Sam Pardon, who is the person bringing the suit.

Third, ask if the witness has been deposed before. This helps you evaluate how much the deponent knows about the ground rules. If the witness has been deposed many times, then ask for the number. You may be dealing with a professional testifier, which is something you would want to know.

Example: Q: Have you ever been deposed, Ms. Jones?
A: Once. [If the witness identifies multiple depositions then ask who, what, where, when, why questions to find out details.]

Fourth, give the deponent some basic instructions.
Example: [1] I am going to be asking you questions today about some of the matters involved in the case. The court reporter will take down everything we say and prepare a complete transcript of the deposition.
[2] The transcript may be used at trial. So although there is no judge or jury sitting here today, you should testify with the same seriousness as if they were. You understand that you are under oath? [Get a "yes" from the deponent, so the witness has a difficult time later claiming a lack of appreciation for the solemnity of the deposition.]
[3] Because the court reporter is trying to take everything down, it will help if we each speak one at a time. I would appreciate it if you would let me finish each question before you start answering, and I will try not to talk over your answers. Okay? [Get a "yes" from the deponent.]
[4] Also, because the court reporter is trying to take everything down, it will help if you try to answer each question out loud with a oral response. It is hard for the court reporter to record nods of the head, and uh-huhs and uh-hums may be ambiguous. Okay? [Get a "yes" out loud from the deponent. It is not unusual for a witness to nod his or her head in response to your question, which presents you with a good opportunity to point out what you mean.]
[5] If you do not understand a question, please let me know that, and I will try to rephrase it. Will you do that? [Get a "yes" from the deponent.] If you do not ask me to rephrase a question. I will assume that you understand it. Okay? [Get a "yes" from the deponent, so the witness has a hard time later claiming confusion as to any particular question.]
[6] If you need to take a break at any time, please let me know. I may ask you to finish answering a particular question or series of questions before we break, but we can certainly pause from time to time. [This humanizes the process a bit, but add the admonition about finishing answers. You do not want the witness to take a break while a question is pending, and then cite your own opening invitation as a basis for doing so.]
[7] Are you taking any medications that might affect your ability to recall events or to testify? [Not all lawyers use this question, because it is extremely personal and can negatively affect your rapport with the witness from the outset. On the other hand, if you expect no rapport with the witness anyway, or you have specific reason to wonder about witness competency, then go ahead and ask. The question is legitimate.]
[8] Lawyers may state objections to questions at a deposition under the relevant court rules. Unless your lawyer expressly instructs you not to answer one of my questions, you must still answer it. A court will later decide whether the objection was well-taken. ^12
