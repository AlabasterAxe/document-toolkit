It is not unusual in commercial cases, for example, for parties to be dealing with trade secrets, business strategies, employment records, and the like. It is similarly standard in personal injury cases to be dealing with medical records. These and other items may be confidential.

Generally, counsel will have entered into a confidentiality stipulation, approved by the court, at the outset of the case. This stipulation and order will spell out the procedures for treating disclosure of sensitive information. Follow the instructions in that order.

The most likely scenario in which confidentiality will become an issue at a deposition is when the witness says that some particular subject of testimony is especially sensitive. A standard approach to handling this scenario is to excuse all persons from the deposition room except the lawyers, the witness, and the court reporter. The questions and answers proceed. At the end of the topic, the court reporter is told to transcribe the sequence into a separate "confidential" volume, which is then available only to the witness and the lawyers in the case. (Other persons may be eligible to see the confidential volume as permitted by the operative stipulation/protective order.) Later, the court will determine the degree of confidentiality, if any, to ascribe at trial to the sensitive testimony. If any exhibits are especially sensitive, handle them in the same way.
