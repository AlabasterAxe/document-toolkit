There may be occasions in which you want the deponent not only to provide oral responses to your questions but also to perform some physical act. For example, you may want the deponent to demonstrate some action (e.g., the range of motion in the deponent's injured shoulder) or to reenact some incident at issue in the suit (e.g., how the deponent was using a product at the time of the accident). Alternatively, you may want the deponent to draw a diagram (e.g., an accident scene) or to provide a handwriting sample (e.g., to try to determine if the deponent was the source of some marginalia on a document). As a threshold matter, there is the issue of whether you can compel the deponent to do any of these things. The courts that have considered this issue are divided. Some courts hold that a deponent is required only to provide oral responses to questions and that the deponent cannot be required to perform some action in the deposition. ^24 Other courts disagree and hold that a deponent can be compelled to perform the types of acts described above. ^25 These courts reason in part that a demonstration or reenactment may provide a more direct and accurate account of an event than a verbal description.

Assuming that the courts in your jurisdiction allow you to compel a deponent to perform nonverbal acts in a deposition, or that the deponent agrees to perform such acts, you need to consider the mechanics of recording these actions for the record. Obviously, if you videotape the deposition, you will have a visual record. Even if you videotape the deposition, however, you also may want to make a verbal record of what the deponent does so that you have a written record of the deponent's action. You may find it considerably easier to attach such a written record to a motion or to impeach the witness at trial with the written transcript.

You certainly need to make such a verbal record of any actions if the deposition is not videotaped. Otherwise, your written transcript will look something like this:

Example: Q: Can you point to the area of your back and neck where you still have pain?
A: It starts right about here and goes all along here to this area.
Q: Where does it hurt the most?
A: [Witness pointing.]
Q: How high can you lift your left arm?
A: Usually only about this high. On a good day, I can sometimes raise it this much higher.

There are different ways to make a verbal record of the deponent's acts. You can observe and orally describe the deponent's action, and then ask the deponent to confirm the accuracy of your description. While opposing counsel can object to your description, you can ask the deponent to correct any inaccuracies.

Example: Q : You are pointing to an area about the size of a baseball directly under your left shoulder blade, is that correct?
A: Yes. It also sometimes hurts down here too.
Q : Now you are pointing to a smaller area just to the left of your spine and right above your belt line, is that right?
A: That's right.
Alternatively, you can instruct the deponent to describe and perform the physical act simultaneously. This may not work very well if the deponent cannot accurately and clearly verbalize his or her actions. In that case, you should supplement the witness's description with your own, and then get the witness to agree with your description.

If you ask the deponent to draw a diagram or to mark on a photograph or other document, you can use multi-colored pens to help create a clear record of what the deponent did.

Example: Q : I'm handing you a blank sheet of paper marked Exhibit 1. Please take this red pen and draw on Exhibit 1 the intersection where the accident occurred. . . . You have drawn two intersecting streets, Elm and Cedar. Is that correct?
A: Yes.
Q : Please now take this blue pen and indicate the point of rest of your car after the accident. . . . Have you done that?
A: Yes.
Q: Please take this green pen and draw the point of rest of the defendant's truck after the accident. . . . You have drawn the point of rest of the defendant's truck in the northbound lane of Cedar Street, is that correct?
A: Yes.

If you are defending the deposition of a witness asked to perform some physical reenactment, you may consider objecting to the request on the grounds that the requested reenactment is too difficult or dangerous, or that it is misleading and assumes facts not in evidence because the setting and/or circumstances in the deposition room are not the same as those at the time of the original incident.

Example: Too dangerous: Let the record reflect that we have moved to the stairwell of my office building. Mr. Smith, I'd like you to show us how you somersaulted down two flights of stairs at my client's apartment building.

Too misleading or difficult: Dr. Jones, would you please take this Milton-Bradley game of "Operation" and show us how you performed a heart transplant on my client.

You might alternatively object to the reenactment but allow it to occur, and then object to the introduction of a videotape of the reenactment at trial. As courts have noted, it does not automatically follow that a videotaped reenactment "taken for discovery purposes [is] admissible into evidence at trial.,"26


^24 See, e.g., Greenidge v. Ruffin, 927 F.2d 789, 793 (4th Cir. 1991) (finding no abuse in discretion for refusing to allow a videotaped deposition of a murder reenactment); Howard v. Michalek, 249 F.R.D. 288, 290 (N.D. Ill. 2008); see also Jones v. Covington, No. 1:15-cv-396, 2015 WL 7721835, at *2 (N.D. Ga. Nov. 30, 2015) (plaintiff may question doctor about his previous examination of a pathology slide, but may not compel doctor to re-read the slide as that would compel the creation of new facts). Keep in mind, however, that a deponent may agree to perform some act in a deposition even if the deponent cannot be compelled to do so.
