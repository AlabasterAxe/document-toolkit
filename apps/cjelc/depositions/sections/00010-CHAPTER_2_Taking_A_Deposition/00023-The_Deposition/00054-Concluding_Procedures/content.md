There are three things to remember about concluding a deposition. The first is instructing the witness, or inviting the witness's lawyer to instruct the witness, about the right to read and sign the transcript. Under the Federal Rules, a deponent has 30 days within which to review and correct a transcript once it is prepared. ^27 If the witness waives the right, or asserts the right but then makes no changes, the transcript is deemed correct as reported. Have the witness state on the record whether the witness intends to exercise the right to review the transcript.

Second, if the witness declares that he or she wants to review the transcript, you should make sure following the deposition that the witness receives notice of the preparation of the transcript and receives a copy to review. Then, you need to make sure that the official transcript includes any corrections. Always review any corrections to determine if the witness has suddenly reversed course on an important answer. If the witness has, you may need to notice a supplemental deposition to explore the change.

Third, in many jurisdictions, court reporters send the original of the deposition transcript to the lawyer who noticed the deposition for storage. Courts do not ordinarily store transcripts, and court reporters do not like using their own file space for this purpose. So it becomes your job.

If you get original transcripts to hold, make sure you set aside a secure space for them. You do not want to misplace the originals of depositions and exhibits that might wind up being used in court.
