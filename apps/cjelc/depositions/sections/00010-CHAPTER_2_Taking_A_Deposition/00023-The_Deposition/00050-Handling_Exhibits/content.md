Handling an exhibit during a deposition is much like handling an exhibit at trial. Here are the basic steps:

- First, pre-mark the document, by handing it to the court reporter for identification. The court reporter will affix the proper number sticker to the document. If you know in advance of the deposition that you will be running through a series of exhibits, give the whole batch to the court reporter to mark before the deposition starts. ^21

Example: Ms. Court Reporter, would you please mark this as Exhibit 36? [Court reporter marks exhibit with correct number and hands the document back to questioning counsel.]

- Second, show the document to the witness, and hand a copy to counsel.

Example: Ms. Jones, I am handing you a two-page document, dated April 16, 2000, marked as Exhibit 36. [Questioning lawyer gives the marked document to the witness and hands a copy to the witness's lawyer and to opposing counsel.]

- Third, find out whether the witness recognizes the document. If the answer is yes, ask the witness to identify the document in sufficient detail to establish a foundation for the witness's substantive testimony about the exhibit. Alternatively, describe the document and then ask the witness to agree with your description.

Example: Q:  Please take a moment to review Exhibit 36, and tell me if you recognize it.
A: Yes.
Q: What is it?
A: It's a letter I wrote on April 16, 2000, to my boss.
Q: Is that your signature at the bottom of page 2 ?
A: Yes. ^22

- Fourth, ask the witness applicable substantive questions. ^23

Examples: What did you mean at the bottom of page one of Exhibit 36, when you said . . .?

Did you read Exhibit 36 when you received it?
How does your company use reports like Exhibit 36 ?

Is it important that reports like Exhibit 36 be accurate?

How long does your company retain reports like Exhibit 36 ?

- Fifth, when you have finished discussing the document with the witness, make sure the original marked exhibit goes back to the court reporter to include with the official transcript of the deposition.

Example: At the end of the discussion, the questioning lawyer hands the marked version of Exhibit 36 back to the court reporter for safekeeping.


^21 The authors are proponents of marking any one unique document only once as an exhibit. Then the document carries that single marking all the way through every deposition in the case and the trial. Re-marking a single document with new numbers every time it is used in new depositions is confusing and unnecessary. (E.g., Jones Exh. 2= Smith Exh. 64= Anderson Exh. 26= Pl. Tr. Exh. 200= Def. Tr. Exh. 82.) Just mark the document once the first time it appears as an exhibit, and forever after refer to the document by that number, no matter when it is used and no matter who uses it. If local rules of practice in your court normally require a different approach, then seek permission from the court to use a single number method.
^22 At this point in a trial, you would offer the exhibit into evidence. That is unnecessary during a deposition. You will wait to make the offer at trial.
^23 One commentator suggests that you may want to consider having the witness highlight on a clean copy of the exhibit those key sections that are important, then have the witness explain the importance of each.
