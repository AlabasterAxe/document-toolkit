# 4. Preserve Trial Testimony 

There are several circumstances under which you may need to take a deposition to preserve trial testimony. These situations include when you have a witness who is expected to be unavailable for trial, a witness who is beyond the reach of a trial subpoena, or a witness who is ill and may become unavailable.

When taking a deposition to preserve trial testimony, you must craft your questions as you would for trial, and you should maintain a trial-like style. Remember that if you ask an objectionable question and fail to rephrase it upon receiving an objection, the testimony that you elicit may be excluded at trial and you will have no opportunity at that point to correct your error. Similarly, if you are defending such a deposition, you must be especially vigilant about objections during the deposition in order to preserve your right to object at trial.
