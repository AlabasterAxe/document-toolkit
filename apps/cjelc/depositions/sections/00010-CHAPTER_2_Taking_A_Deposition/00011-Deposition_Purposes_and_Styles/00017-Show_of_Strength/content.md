An important but occasionally overlooked purpose of a deposition is as a show of strength. Through carefully selected questions or exhibits and strong, favorable witnesses, you can demonstrate to opposing counsel and the opposing party the strength of your position or the weakness of their own. You can then use this as leverage in your settlement discussions. Given the costs associated with a trial and the inherent risks that a trial brings, it may be best to preview certain strengths of your case through a deposition in the hope of encouraging an earlier and more favorable conclusion to the litigation. If the deposition is particularly effective, you may consider following it with an offer of judgment. ^8 Such a strategy has the advantage of requiring a quick response, while the memory of your devastating deposition is still fresh.
