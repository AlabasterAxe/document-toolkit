She clearly established confidentiality and the attorney-client relationship, created client rapport, and systematically gathered the required information from the client. The only suggestion for improvement I had was to make sure she&#39;s referencing the In-Person Intake Form during the interview to get a full picture of the client&#39;s financial picture.</p>
<h1>Strong Points</h1>
<p>Eqra clearly established confidentiality at the beginning of our interview. She took care to explain the limits of our attorney-client relationship and made it clear that she could not make any promises regarding future representation of the client. In addition, she explained that she is a legal intern working under the supervision of two practicing attorneys who review the work of the interns.</p>
<p>Throughout the interview, Eqra created a welcoming and non-judgmental atmosphere that made me feel comfortable sharing sensitive information about my situation. I never felt as if Eqra was judging me, which encouraged open and honest communication. I felt that Eqra&#39;s approach would go a long way toward reassuring prospective clients who may feel embarrassed or ashamed about being victimized. </p>
<p>Eqra did a really good job of making sure she had a complete understanding of the client&#39;s situation. She asked for relevant documents early in the interview process and asked open-ended questions at the end to ensure she hadn&#39;t missed any important details or aspects of the case. This gave me additional opportunities to share information that might have slipped through the cracks earlier in the interview.</p>
<p>Finally, one small but very positive detail that stood out is that when I mentioned that I had gotten a legal notice, she expressed that it was very important that she understand what that legal notice was in case there was a time-sensitive matter for the client. Her tone remained professional but it effectively communicated that this was an important matter.</p>
<h1>Suggestion for Improvement</h1>
<p>While the interview covered many important aspects of the case, I think it would have been good for Eqra to do a more systematic review of the client&#39;s sources of income earlier in the process. We didn&#39;t cover my sources of income until later in the interview, so it&#39;s possible this could have been missed. That said, this problem was mitigated by Eqra doing a good job of repeatedly prompting me to see if there was anything else I had to share, so these details came out eventually. </p>
