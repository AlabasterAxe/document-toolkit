Overall, Eqra conducted a really strong mock client interview that followed the example intakes in our seminar. She clearly established confidentiality and the attorney-client relationship, created client rapport, and systematically gathered the required information from the client. The only suggestion for improvement I had was to make sure she's referencing the In-Person Intake Form during the interview to get a full picture of the client's financial picture.

# Strong Points

Eqra clearly established confidentiality at the beginning of our interview. She took care to explain the limits of our attorney-client relationship and made it clear that she could not make any promises regarding future representation of the client. In addition, she explained that she is a legal intern working under the supervision of two practicing attorneys who review the work of the interns.

Throughout the interview, Eqra created a welcoming and non-judgmental atmosphere that made me feel comfortable sharing sensitive information about my situation. I never felt as if Eqra was judging me, which encouraged open and honest communication. I felt that Eqra's approach would go a long way toward reassuring prospective clients who may feel embarrassed or ashamed about being victimized. 

Eqra did a really good job of making sure she had a complete understanding of the client's situation. She asked for relevant documents early in the interview process and asked open-ended questions at the end to ensure she hadn't missed any important details or aspects of the case. This gave me additional opportunities to share information that might have slipped through the cracks earlier in the interview.

Finally, one small but very positive detail that stood out is that when I mentioned that I had gotten a legal notice, she expressed that it was very important that she understand what that legal notice was in case there was a time-sensitive matter for the client. Her tone remained professional but it effectively communicated that this was an important matter.

# Suggestion for Improvement

While the interview covered many important aspects of the case, I think it would have been good for Eqra to do a more systematic review of the client's sources of income earlier in the process. We didn't cover my sources of income until later in the interview, so it's possible this could have been missed. That said, this problem was mitigated by Eqra doing a good job of repeatedly prompting me to see if there was anything else I had to share, so these details came out eventually.
