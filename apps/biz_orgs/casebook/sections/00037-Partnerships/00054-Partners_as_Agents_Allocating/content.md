Partnerships face a contractual risk common to all agency relationships: under some circumstances they may be accountable to third parties for a partner's unauthorized action. In a partnership setting, the question centers on the extent of a general partner's agency authority.

State partnership statutes provide specific rules delineating a general partner's authority. Such statutes incorporate by reference the law of agency, and should be interpreted in light of the law of agency, including the principles of actual and apparent authority, as well as related doctrines relating to vicarious liability and estoppel to deny the authority of an agent (see discussion of these principles in Chapter 1 at pages 42-57).

Under agency law, authority comes from the principal's manifestations of consent to either the agent or the third party. The extent of a particular agent's authority thus depends on a case-by-case analysis to determine what manifestations have been made and whether these manifestations are sufficient to create authority in a particular case. The broadest possible grant of agency power is the general agency power granted to one who is the general manager in charge of the entire business. However, the existence of that authority must be traceable to a manifestation of consent by the principal, requiring application of agency principles.

As explained in 1 A. Bromberg and L. Ribstein, Bromberg and Ribstein on Partnership, UPA (1997) § 301 and its predecessor UPA (1914) § 9 make this case-by-case inquiry and application of agency doctrines unnecessary to determine the nature of a particular partner's actual agency power:

If §9(1) went no further than providing that the partner is an agent of the partnership, it would be left to general agency law to determine the consequences of the partner's status. . . . The effect of §9(1) is to characterize a partner as a particular type of agent, at least in the absence of contrary evidence. A partner's actual or apparent authority, or inherent agency power, is equivalent in scope to the authority that can be implied from the position of a general managerial agent, as distinguished from one who engages in merely ministerial acts or acts only in connection with a particular phase of the business.

The following case explores the application of agency and partnership law principles in one of the most controversial settings-real estate transactions.

Veggie Creations, Inc. v. HBK-Willow, LLC<br>United States District Court, C.D. California, 2017 2017 WL 2713739

R. Gary Klausner, United States District Judge.

# I. Introduction 

On May 26, 2016, Veggie Creations, Inc. ("Veggie Creations" or "VCI") filed a Complaint against HBK-Willow, LLC ("HBK") and APPA Valley Farms Real Estate Partnership ("APPA"). VCI alleges claims against HBK for (1) Declaratory Judgment, (2) Quiet Title, and (3) Intentional Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage. VCI alleges claims against APPA for (1) Quiet Title and (2) Promissory Estoppel.

On August 17, 2016, HBK filed a Third Party Complaint against Michael Rindt and Thom Rindt (both of whom are minority partners of APPA) for Breach of Contract and Intentional Interference with Contractual Relations. On the same day, HBK filed a Counterclaim against VCI, and a Crossclaim against APPA, also alleging Breach of Contract and Intentional Interference with Contractual Relations. HBK filed an Amended Counterclaim on November 15, 2016.

On February 17, 2017, HBK filed the instant Motion for Summary Judgment as to the three claims against HBK in VCI's Complaint. For the following reasons, the Court GRANTS HBK's Motion.

## III. Factual Background

APPA Valley Farms Real Estate Partnership ("APPA") is a general partnership that invests in real estate in Southern California. APPA has four partners: brothers Thom Rindt ("Thom") and Michael Rindt ("Michael"), their father Klaus Rindt ("Klaus"), and Jeffrey Knowles ("Knowles"). Under APPA's partnership agreement, the managing partner has sole control over the partnership's business operations, which includes the authority to lease, buy, or sell partnership property. Thom was APPA's original managing partner, but the partners amended their partnership agreement in 2007 to make Klaus the managing partner, and he has held that position ever since.

After 2007, Klaus held himself out as the managing partner, and Thom recognized Klaus' sole authority to conduct partnership business relating to real estate transactions, as evidenced by a chain of emails in which Thom introduced Klaus to VCI's owner. Jay Highman, because VCI was interested in purchasing a piece of property from APPA. It is undisputed that in that email exchange, Klaus told Highman that he was APPA's managing partner, and that while he listens to the other partners' recommendations regarding real estate transactions, Klaus ultimately makes decisions for the partnership.

At issue in this case is a piece of property that APPA owned, located at 135 Klug Circle in Corona, California ("the Property"). The Property, which APPA had been leasing to VCI, contains a state-of-the-art food processing plant. Despite VCI's previous interest in purchasing the property. APPA agreed to sell the Property to HBK on February 22, 2016. Klaus authorized the sale as APPA's managing partner, and he signed the purchase-sale agreement.

During a March 29, 2016 conference call, it is undisputed that HBK notified VCI that it had purchased the Property and that VCI would need to vacate the premises by January 1, 2017. HBK also indicated that it would not be entering into a new longterm lease of the Property with VCI.

This is where things get messy. The parties dispute what else was said on the March 29 conference call. HBK contends that Thom and Michael, who were also on the call, told VCI that since the sale to HBK hadn't yet closed, they could give VCI a new two-year lease of the Property on behalf of APPA. HBK contends that it objected to this assertion, and informed VCI, Thom, and Michael that only Klaus (who was not on the call) had the authority to enter into such a lease before the sale to HBK closed. VCI contends that no such conversation about a new lease occurred, and that HBK never told VCI that only Klaus had the authority to sign a new lease. It is undisputed, however, that two days later on April 1, 2016, Thom and Michael signed a new twoyear lease of the Property to VCI, purportedly on behalf of APPA. . . . Klaus was not told about this new lease, and never authorized it as APPA's managing partner. In fact, Klaus explicitly promised HBK in the purchase-sale agreement that APPA would not enter into any new leases for the Property before closing.

VCI subsequently recorded its new purported lease, which HBK only learned about on April 29, 2016, just one day before escrow closed on its own purchase of the Property. Predictably, both VCI and HBK think that the other's claim to the Property is invalid, and both also blame APPA for creating this dispute in the first place. . . .

# IV. Discussion 

While there are numerous complaints, third party complaints, counterclaims, and crossclaims involved in this case, the instant Motion only covers VCI's claims against HBK. . . .
# B. VCI'S CLAIMS AS TO THE LEASE OF THE PROPERTY 

VCI's claims relating to its purported lease of the Property are a different story. VCI seeks a declaratory judgement that the new two-year lease is valid, and the parties hotly dispute this issue. VCI also brings claims against HBK for quiet title and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage relating to the lease. Because these last two claims are both predicated on the lease's validity, the Court addresses all three of VCI's claims against HBK together.

VCI's claims against HBK all hinge on the following question: Is the new twoyear lease of the Property that VCI entered into on April 1, 2016, valid and enforceable? If the answer is yes, VCI is entitled to relief on its first two claims for declaratory judgment and quiet title, and it may also be entitled to relief on its third claim for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage. If the answer is no, however, HBK is entitled to summary judgment on all three of VCI's claims against it, since they are all premised on the lease's validity. To be entitled to summary judgment on VCI's claims, therefore, HBK must prove that the undisputed facts show an absence of evidence as to the lease's validity.

In order for a lease agreement entered into by a partnership to be valid, the persons entering into the lease on behalf of the partnership must have had authority to do so. See UPA (1997) Act §301. HBK argues that here, the undisputed facts show that neither of the Rindt Bros had authority to enter into a two-year lease with VCI on behalf of APPA, and that the lease is therefore invalid.

There are two types of authority that individual partners can have to bind a partnership: (1) actual authority, and (2) ostensible authority. See Cal. Corp. Code §16301. HBK argues that the Rindt Bros had neither actual nor ostensible authority. The Court will address each type of authority in turn.

## 1. Actual Authority to Lease the Property

HBK first points out that the Rindt Bros lacked actual authority under the APPA partnership agreement to enter into a lease of partnership property. Under APPA's partnership agreement, the managing partner "shall have control over the business of the Partnership and assume direction of its business operations." (APPA P'ship Agreement §14. . . ) Further, while " [t] he managing Partner shall consult and confer as far as practicable with the nonmanaging Partners . . . the power of decision shall be vested in the managing Partner." (Id.) While the APPA Partnership Agreement initially named Thom as managing partner, the partners signed an amendment to the Partnership Agreement in 2007 ("the 2007 Amendment"), which stated that "[t]he Managing Partner shall be Klaus G. Rindt, as the partner with the largest capital interest of all partners." (APPA Am. P'Ship Agreement . . . .) . . .

In short, the genuinely undisputed facts show that Klaus was the managing partner of APPA at all times relevant to this case. As discussed above, the APPA Partnership Agreement clearly states that the managing partner has sole authority to conduct partnership business. Because at the relevant time Klaus had sole actual authority to control APPA's business operations, which includes managing its real estate holdings, it logically follows that Thom and Michael could not have had actual authority to enter into the two-year lease with VCI.
# 2. Ostensible Authority to Lease the Property 

Even if Thom and Michael did not have actual authority to enter into the twoyear lease, the lease may nonetheless be valid if Thom and Michael had "ostensible" authority to enter into the lease. Under California law:


#### Abstract

An act of a partner, including the execution of an instrument in the partnership name, for apparently carrying on in the ordinary course the partnership business or business of the kind carried on by the partnership binds the partnership, unless the partner had no authority to act for the partnership in the particular matter and the person with whom the partner was dealing knew or had received a notification that the partner lacked authority.


Cal. Corp. Code § 16301(1).

## a. Ordinary Course of Partnership Business

HBK first argues that signing the two-year lease for the Property was not "in the ordinary course the partnership business or business of the kind carried on by the partnership." If signing the two-year lease was outside the course of the partnership business, then another provision ( §16301(2) ) would dictate that the lease would only be valid if it was approved by all of the partners. Because Klaus did not approve of the lease, a determination that signing the lease was not in the ordinary course of business would mean that the lease was invalid.

The Court, however, disagrees with HBK's characterization of APPA's ordinary course of business. HBK attempts to argue that because APPA had already sold the Property to HBK-and promised not to enter into any new leases without HBK's consent-entering into a new lease would certainly be outside the ordinary course of APPA's business. In so arguing, however, HBK apparently ignores §16301 (1)'s use of the word "apparently," as well as the disjunctive phrase "or business of the kind carried on by the partnership." In order to trigger §16301(1), the act of a partner need only appear to be of the kind ordinarily carried on by the partnership. At the time, APPA was in the business of purchasing and leasing real property to generate investment income. Signing long-term leases of partnership property thus fits squarely within the type of action apparently taken "in the ordinary course" of "business of the kind carried on" by APPA. It doesn't matter that the action was actually contrary to APPA's specific business interests- §16301 's ordinary-course inquiry is directed at the apparent nature of the partnership's business generally. C.f. Blackmon v. Hale, 1 Cal.3d 548, 557 (1970) ("The apparent scope of the partnership business depends primarily on the conduct of the partnership and its partners and what they cause third persons to believe about the authority of the partners.").

## b. Knowledge or Notification Exception

HBK next argues that, even if signing the two-year lease was in the ordinary course of business, this action falls within §16301 (1)'s exception for instances where "the partner had no authority to act for the partnership in the particular matter and the person with whom the partner was dealing knew or had received a notification that the partner lacked authority." In other words, a partnership will not be bound by the action of one of its partners, even if the action was in the ordinary course of business, when the partner lacked actual authority to take the action, and counter-party was on notice of this fact. The Court agrees with HBK that this exception applies here.

While the parties dispute whether VCI was informed that only Klaus had authority to enter into a new lease of the Property on the March 29 conference call, there is no genuine dispute that VCI had been previously notified of Klaus' sole authority to conduct real estate transactions on behalf of APPA. VCI received such notice through an email exchange in June, 2015, just nine months before VCI entered into the purported new lease with Thom and Michael. In this exchange, Thom introduced Jay Highman, VCI's owner, to Klaus because VCI was interested in doing a real estate transaction with APPA. This alone should have tipped off VCI that Thom did not himself have authority to conduct real estate transactions on behalf of APPA. But the email exchange did not stop there. Klaus explicitly laid out his sole authority to conduct business operations on behalf of APPA, which included entering into real estate transactions. Klaus referred to the final decision on real estate transactions being "[his] decision," and characterized Thom's view on the matter as merely a "recommendation." Klaus further informed Highman that Klaus was APPA's "managing partner with a 42.8% stake in the partnership."

It may be true that Thom and Michael told VCI that they had authority to execute real-estate transactions on APPA's behalf, and VCI may have hoped that they in fact did. Nonetheless, VCI does not genuinely dispute that it was at least on notice of the fact that Klaus was APPA's managing partner, and that Klaus had sole authority to conduct business on APPA's behalf. By entering into a long-term lease agreement without contacting Klaus, VCI was knowingly taking the risk that Thom and Michael had no authority, and that the lease would be invalidated. VCI cannot now fall back on §16301 (1) for protection since this risk came to fruition, because the undisputed facts show that VCI was previously notified about Klaus' sole decision-making authority regarding APPA's real-estate transactions.

As such, the Court concludes that the Rindt Bros lacked ostensible authority under §16301 (1) to enter into the new two-year lease with VCI on behalf of APPA.

# c. Statement of Partnership Authority 

VCI contends that even if the Rindt Bros had no ostensible authority to sign the lease under §16301 (1), they nonetheless have such authority under an exception to §16301. Section 16303 (d) provides that, under limited circumstances, a partner may have authority to act on behalf of the partnership pursuant to a signed "statement of partnership authority," notwithstanding a lack of authority under §16301.

Section 16303(d) contains two provisions: §16303 (d) (2) covers authority to transfer real property held in the name of the partnership, and §16303 (d) (1) covers authority to take all other actions on behalf of the partnership. The statute explicitly includes leasing within the meaning of transferring real property. Cal. Corp. Code §16101(18).
To be given effect under §16303(~d)(1), a statement of partnership authority need only be "filed." Because §16303(~d)(2) deals with transfers of real property, however, it includes a more stringent requirement that the statement be "recorded in the office for recording transfers of [the] real property [at issue]."2

In this case, it is undisputed that APPA's Statement of Partnership Authority was only filed with the Secretary of State of California, and was not filed with the Riverside County Recorder's Office, which is "the office for recording transfers of real property" located in Riverside County. As such, the Court concludes that VCI cannot take advantage of §16303(~d)(2).

The Rindt Bros, therefore, lacked authority under §16303(~d)(2) to enter into the two-year lease with VCI on behalf of APPA. . . .

# VI. CONCLUSION 

In light of the foregoing, the Court finds that the undisputed facts show a lack of evidence that the Rindt Bros had any authority to enter into a new two-year lease with VCI on behalf of APPA.

Pursuant to APPA's Partnership Agreement, Thom and Michael lacked actual authority to enter into the lease. Under §16301(1), Thom and Michael also lacked ostensible authority to enter into the lease because VCI was on notice that only Klaus had such authority. Finally, the exception to §16301 contained in §16303(~d)(2) does not apply because APPA's Statement of Partnership Authority was not properly recorded.

Because all three of VCI's claims against HBK are predicated on the lease's validity, the Court concludes that HBK is entitled to summary judgment on VCI's claims.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS HBK's Motion. IT IS SO ORDERED.

## NOTE: AUTHORITY OF JOINT VENTURERS

A number of cases suggest that the apparent or inherent agency power of a joint venturer may be less than that of a general partner. Properly analyzed, the difference in agency power is a function of the fundamental difference between a joint venture and a general partnership.

2. Section 16303(d) (2): "A grant of authority to transfer real property held in the name of the partnership contained in a certified copy of a filed statement of partnership authority recorded in the office for recording transfers of that real property is conclusive in favor of a person who gives value without knowledge to the contrary, so long as and to the extent that a certified copy of a filed statement containing a limitation on that authority is not then of record in the office for recording transfers of that real property. The recording in the office for recording transfers of that real property of a certified copy of a filed cancellation of a limitation on authority revives the previous grant of authority."
A joint venture is for a limited purpose and normally involves a less than total merging of the interests and assets of the venturers. Thus, it is not reasonable to assume that the venturers have granted each other the authority of a general manager. Of course, in a particular case, the venturers may grant such authority to one or more of their number. But the common law does not assume that such grant of general agency power has been made. Instead, the party seeking to bind the joint venture must establish the extent of the agent's actual authority. If that actual authority is limited, then the apparent or inherent authority of the joint venturer may also be less than would accompany a more general grant of authority.

In contrast, a general partnership normally involves a complete merging of interests and assets to carry on a business. It is reasonable to believe that partners in such ventures would usually grant each other the agency power appropriate for a general managerial agent. Consistent with that reasoning, UPA §9 creates a presumption on which third parties without knowledge to the contrary may rely-that all general partners have the actual authority of a general managerial agent.

An instructive case is Matanuska Valley Bank v. Arnold, 223 F.2d 778 (9th Cir. 1955). Irene Arnold and Willard Davis entered a joint venture for the purpose of completing one construction contract. Arnold's part of the bargain was to provide the needed capital, thought to be $10,000. She did this by borrowing the money from her bank, which knew the details of the venture. Later, Davis borrowed money from Arnold's bank in the name of the venture and used the proceeds for personal purposes. The court refused to hold Arnold responsible for the note as a co-venturer:

Davis, as a joint adventurer, did not have the general implied authority of a partner in an ordinary trading or commercial partnership.

The power of one joint venturer to bind another must be derived from express authority or by implication from the nature of the agreement in the particular circumstances of each case.

In the instant case we find no evidence of express authority having been given Davis to execute the notes on behalf of the firm, nor can authority be implied. We have a situation where the parties were contemplating no long range operation which might carry with it future financing by means of borrowing. The parties must have contemplated that the contract price would finance the job; that the necessary preliminary financing would be taken care of by the $10,000 advanced by the bank and secured by Mrs. Arnold's notes. . . . It seems clear that the proper implication to be drawn from all the circumstances is that if future borrowing became necessary the manner in which it would be accomplished was a matter for future agreement.

# 223 F.2d at 780 . 

There are a number of cases in accord with Matanuska Valley Bank v. Arnold. However, there are also a number of jurisdictions that do not recognize a distinction between the authority of a joint venturer and a general partner. For a discussion of the different judicial approaches, see Comment, Apparent Authority and the Joint Venture: Narrowing the Scope of Agency Between Business Associates, 13 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 831 (1980).

## PROBLEM 2-13

John Harris, an investment broker, contacted the law firm of Watts \& Watts for assistance in obtaining a divorce. The attorney to whom he first spoke referred him to Susan Armor, representing that "she's our best partner in the domestic relations area." Armor represented Harris in the divorce, in connection with which she met with him numerous times at Watts \& Watts' law office. Several months after the divorce, Armor had lunch with Harris, who lamented the lack of good investments to sell clients wanting high return and low risk. Armor told Harris that Watts \& Watts was making lucrative foreign investments and was eager to take money in $100,000 units for one year at a time and pay 15 percent interest, a rate double the then prime lending rate. Later that afternoon, Armor visited Harris's office, where he gave her a $1.5 million check made out in her name. In return Harris received 15 promissory notes naming Watts \& Watts as the promisor, and executed by "Susan Armor, partner in charge of overseas investments."

Armor disappeared one week later, and it is rumored that her assets were transferred to unreachable foreign bank accounts. Watts \& Watts was completely unaware of Armor's fraudulent representations or actions. Is Watts \& Watts liable to Harris for the $1.5 million that Harris "loaned the firm"?

# PROBLEM 2-14 

Jones and Investor formed a partnership to own and operate a sporting goods store. Investor agreed to contribute needed capital, and Jones agreed to manage the sporting goods store. Investor and Jones agreed to share profits and losses equally. After one year of operation, Investor asked Jones to stop making inventory purchases on credit. Jones refused. Thereafter, Investor wrote the partnership's principal suppliers demanding that they cease selling goods to the firm on credit and stating that Investor would not be personally responsible for any additional credit extended to the partnership. Thereafter, Dense, one of the suppliers so notified, at the request of Jones sold and delivered sporting goods to the firm on credit. Are the partnership and Investor liable for the sums owed Dense?
