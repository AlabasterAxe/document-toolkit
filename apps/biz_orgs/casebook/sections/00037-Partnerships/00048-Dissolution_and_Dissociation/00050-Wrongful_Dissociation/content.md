The rules governing partner dissociation and partnership dissolution necessarily must strike a balance between the individual partners' ability to adapt to changed circumstances and the firm's desire for stability and continuity. Partnership law default norms emphasize individual adaptability. Normally, any partner can withdraw from the partnership at will, force a liquidating judicial sale, and receive the net value of her partnership interest in cash. Partners wishing to continue the business, absent agreement, must purchase the partnership's assets for cash at the judicial sale. Conversely, a majority group of partners may force out another partner by collectively dissociating themselves from the unwanted partner. Again, however, partners wishing to continue the business must purchase it at the resulting judicial sale.

The value of the individual partner's unilateral right to exit and the dominant group of partners' unilateral right to expel an unwanted partner must be weighed against the costs. From the standpoint of partners wishing to continue the business, it may be costly to replace the human and money capital of a valuable departing partner. Moreover, the continuing partners may be subject to opportunistic threats of exit by a strong partner who seeks to obtain unfair concessions from the other partners. From the standpoint of a minority partner, the easy exit and expulsion rights present the risk of opportunism by a dominant group having specialized skills or unique commercial ties with the partnership. The dominant group may use expulsion rights or react to the minority partner's exit by purchasing or threatening to purchase the partnership's assets at an unfairly low price.

Partners can easily shift the balance between adaptability and continuity by agreeing that the partnership will continue for a fixed term or particular undertaking. So doing brings into play the wrongful dissociation provisions of partnership law. If a partner dissociates from the partnership before completion of the agreed term or undertaking, such dissociation will be wrongful. Non-dissociating partners have the option of continuing the partnership's business without the consent of the wrongfully dissociating partner. Additionally, the wrongfully dissociating partner must compensate other partners for damages resulting from the wrongful dissociation.

The consequences of wrongful dissociation are potentially devastating. Moreover, as partnership relations deteriorate, or the interests of partners begin to diverge, partners may unwittingly take actions that put them at risk in later court proceedings. Often unclear to the partners and their advisers are the answers to two questions. First, is their partnership at will or for a term or undertaking? Second, have they already conducted themselves in a way that will be labeled wrongful?

# Drashner v. Sorenson <br> Supreme Court of South Dakota, 1954 <br> 63 N.W.2d 255 

Smith, Presiding Judge.
In January 1951 the plaintiff, C. H. Drashner, and defendants, A. D. Sorenson and Jacob P. Deis, associated themselves as co-owners in the real estate, loan and insurance business at Rapid City. For a consideration of $7500 they purchased the real estate and insurance agency known as J. Schumacher Co. located in an office room on the ground floor of the Alex Johnson Hotel building. The entire purchase price was advanced for the partnership by the defendants, but at the time of trial $3,000 of that sum had been repaid to them by the partnership. Although, as will appear from facts presently to be outlined, their operations were not unsuccessful, differences arose and on June 15, 1951 plaintiff commenced this action in which he sought an accounting, dissolution and winding up of the partnership. The answer and counterclaim of defendants prayed for like relief.

The cause came on for trial September 4, 1951. The court among others made the following findings.

The conclusions adopted read as follows:

1. "That the defendants are entitled to continue the partnership and have the value of the plaintiff's interest in the partnership business determined, upon the filing and approval of a good and sufficient bond, conditioned upon the release of the plaintiff from any liability arising out of the said partnership, and further conditioned upon the payment by the defendants to the plaintiff of the value of plaintiff's interest in the partnership as determined by the Court."

II. "That in computing the value of the plaintiff's interest in the said partnership, the value of the good will of the business shall not be considered."

III. "That the value of the partnership shall be finally determined upon a hearing before this Court, . . ." and IV. "That the plaintiff shall be entitled to receive one-third of the value of the partnership property owned by the partnership on the 12th day of September, 1951, not including the good will of the business, after the payment of the liabilities of the partnership and the payment to the defendants of the invested capital in the sum of $4,500.00."

Judgment was accordingly entered dissolving the partnership as of September 12, 1951.

After hearing at a later date the court found . . . "[t]hat there is not sufficient partnership property to reimburse the defendants for their invested capital." Thereupon the court decree "[t]hat the plaintiff had no interest in the property of the said partnership," and that the defendants were the sole owners thereof. . . .

The agreement of the parties contemplated an association which would continue at least until the $7500 advance of defendants had been repaid from the gross earnings of the business. Hence, it was not a partnership at will. Vangel v. Vangel, 116 Cal. App. 2d 615, 254 P.2d 919; Zeibak v. Nasser, 12 Cal. 2d 1, 82 P.2d 375. In apparent recognition of that fact, both plaintiff and defendants sought dissolution in contravention of the partnership agreement, see SDC 49.0603(2) under SDC 49.0604(1)(d) on the ground that the adverse party had caused the dissolution wrongfully by willfully and persistently committing a breach of the partnership agreement, and by so conducting himself in matters relating to the partnership business as to render impracticable the carrying on of the business in partnership with him.

By SDC 49.0610(2) of the Uniform Partnership Act it is provided:

When dissolution is caused in contravention of the partnership agreement the rights of the partners shall be as follows:

(b) The partners who have not caused the dissolution wrongfully, if they all desire to continue the business in the same name, either by themselves or jointly with others, may do so, during the agreed term for the partnership and for that purpose may possess the partnership property, provided they secure the payment by bond approved by the Court, or pay to any partner who has caused the dissolution wrongfully, the value of his interest in the partnership at the dissolution less any damages recoverable under clause (2)(a)(2) of this section and in like manner indemnify him against all present or future partnership liabilities. . . .

From this background we turn to a consideration of the evidence from which the trial court inferred that plaintiff caused the dissolution wrongfully.

The breach between the parties resulted from a continuing controversy over the right of plaintiff to withdraw sufficient money from the partnership to defray his living expenses. Plaintiff was dependent upon his earnings for the support of his family. The defendants had other resources. Plaintiff claimed that he was to be permitted to draw from the earnings of the partnership a sufficient amount to support himself and family. The defendants asserted that there was a definite arrangement for the allocation of the income of the partnership and there was no agreement for withdrawal by plaintiff of more than his allotment under that plan. Defendants' version of the facts was corroborated by a written admission of plaintiff offered in evidence.

From evidence thus sharply in conflict, the trial court made a finding, reading as follows:

That the oral partnership agreement between the parties provided that each of the three partners were to draw as compensation one-third of one-half of the commissions earned upon sales made by the partners; that the other one-half of the commissions earned on sales made by the partners and one-half of the commissions earned upon sales made by salesmen employed by the partnership, together with the earnings from the insurance business carried on by the partnership, was to be placed in a fund to be used for the payment of the operating expenses of the partnership, and after the payment of such operating expenses to be used to reimburse the defendants for the capital advanced in the purchase of the Julius Schumacher business and the capital advanced in the sum of Eight Hundred Dollars ( $800.00 ) for the operating expenses of the business.

As an outgrowth of this crucial difference, there was evidence from which a court could reasonably believe that plaintiff neglected the business and spent too much time in a nearby bar during business hours. At a time when plaintiff had overdrawn his partners and was also indebted to one of defendants for personal advances, he requested $100 and his request was refused. In substance he then said, according to the testimony of the defendant Deis, that he would see that he "gets some money to run on," and if they "didn't give it to him he was going to dissolve the partnership and see that he got it." Thereafter plaintiff pressed his claims through counsel, and eventually brought this action to dissolve the partnership. The claim so persistently asserted was contrary to the partnership agreement found by the court.

The foregoing picture of the widening breach between the parties is drawn almost entirely from the evidence of defendants. Of course, plaintiff's version of the agreement of the parties, and of the ensuing differences, if believed, would have supported findings of a different order by the trier of the fact. It cannot be said, we think, that the trial court acted unreasonably in believing defendants, and we think it equally clear the court could reasonably conclude that the insistent and continuing demands of the plaintiff and his attendant conduct rendered it reasonably impracticable to carry on the business in partnership with him. It follows, we are of the opinion, the evidence supports the finding that plaintiff caused the dissolution wrongfully. Zeibak v. Nasser, 12 Cal. 2d 1, 82 P.2d 375; Owen v. Cohen, 19 Cal. 2d 147, 119 P.2d 713; Meherin v. Meherin, 93 Cal. App. 2d 459, 209 P.2d 36; and Vangel v. Vangel, 116 Cal. App. 2d 615, 254 P.2d 919. . . .

The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.

# McCormick v. Brevig 

Supreme Court of Montana, 2004
96 P.3d 697
[The facts of this case are set forth supra, beginning at page 115.]
Did the District Court err in ruling that Clark did not dissociate by withdrawing from the Partnership?

In her amended complaint, Joan petitioned the District Court for an order expelling Clark from the Partnership pursuant to §35-10-616, MCA, as a result of his allegedly wrongful conduct of converting Partnership assets to his own personal use. Following a non-jury trial, the District Court concluded that neither party had dissociated from the Partnership, and denied Joan's request for an order of expulsion.

On appeal, Joan contends that the District Court failed to consider evidence showing that Clark had dissociated from the Partnership pursuant to §35-10-616(5), MCA. She argues that the court failed to consider evidence that Clark had denied the existence of the Partnership and had taken steps to transfer legal title of the Partnership's primary asset - the ranch - to his name, and had converted over $400,000 of Partnership funds to his own personal use. She further maintains that the court erred in denying her request for expulsion in light of the fact that Clark had instigated criminal theft charges against her in 1994, which later proved frivolous. In response, Clark asserts that the District Court adequately considered each of the events leading to dissociation under §35-10-616, MCA, and properly denied Joan's request for expulsion.

Section 35-10-616, MCA, delineates ten events causing a partner's dissociation from a partnership. Pursuant to §35-10-616(5), MCA, one of the ways a partner may be dissociated is expulsion by judicial decree, made upon the application by the partnership or another partner, because:
(a) the partner engaged in wrongful conduct that adversely and materially affected the partnership business;
(b) the partner willfully or persistently committed a material breach of the partnership agreement or of a duty owed to the partnership or other partners under §35-10-405, MCA;
(c) the partner engaged in conduct relating to the partnership business that made it not reasonably practical to carry on business in partnership with that partner. . . .

Dissociation under § 35-10-616(5), MCA, is considered wrongful. Section 35-10$617(1)(\mathrm{b})(\mathrm{ii}), \mathrm{MCA}$.

In this case, Joan's amended complaint did not specifically request relief pursuant to §35-10-616(5), MCA, and it is evident from the record that the District Court considered her claim generally under §35-10-616, MCA. In so doing, the District Court found that Clark had not given notice of his express will to withdraw as a partner, that the partnership agreement did not apply, and that Clark had continued to work the ranch since his alleged dissociation in 1994, which Joan and the Partnership had benefitted from. The court further noted that, although Clark had obtained loans in his individual name from 1994 forward, this did not constitute dissociation since it was a necessary action in light of the parties' inability to communicate about ranch finances. . . .

Based upon these findings, which Joan does not dispute, we cannot disagree with the District Court's conclusion that Clark did not dissociate from the Partnership. While Joan contends that the District Court failed to consider evidence that Clark wrongfully converted over $400,000 of Partnership funds to his personal use, it does not appear from the record that Joan raised this argument before the District Court in a timely fashion. Rather, the record shows that these allegations first surfaced following trial and the appointment of a special master.

Additionally, Joan's contention that Clark dissociated from the Partnership by instigating criminal theft charges against her fails. The District Court weighed this evidence at trial and rejected it, finding that both parties were at least partially at fault for the deterioration of the Partnership. The court also noted that the act of taking alternate legal positions during the course of the dispute did not amount to dissociation. Because Joan has not established that the District Court's findings were clearly erroneous, we conclude the court did not err in concluding that Clark did not dissociate from the Partnership pursuant to §35-10-616, MCA. . . .

# NOTES AND QUESTIONS 

1. Was it fair for the Court to determine that Drashner had caused the dissolution of the partnership wrongfully? Would it have been better to conclude, as did the Court in Brevig, that both sides of the intra-partnership dispute bore some of the blame?
2. When a court concludes, as in Drashner, that a partner's conduct over a period of time has caused a dissolution of the partnership, it will also be necessary to determine when dissolution occurred. In such circumstances, will the date of dissolution be the date on which the first such act occurred? The date the civil action was filed? Every case stands on its own facts, and a "court has broad powers to act in equity to determine the date of dissolution (citation omitted)." Brown v. Hallisey, 2004 WL 3218003, at *5 (Mass. Super. Ct. Nov. 4, 2004).

## PROBLEM 2-9

Alpha, Beta, Charlie, and Delta formed a partnership in Nirvana several years ago. Nirvana adopted the UPA (1914) in 1937 and the UPA (1997) in 1999. It is unclear which version of the UPA governs the ABCD partnership. The ABCD partnership is governed by a written agreement that provides in relevant part as follows:

Article 3. Duration. The partnership shall continue until December 31, 2025.
Relations between Beta and the other partners have been deteriorating for months due to Beta's insistence that she be given a larger share of partnership profits to reflect her highly successful "rainmaking." In each of the following circumstances, determine whether Beta has "wrongfully" dissociated or caused dissolution "wrongfully." Then determine what rights she and the other partners have as a result of her dissociation.

Circumstance \#1. On January 10, 2021, Beta delivers written notice to the other partners that she is withdrawing from the partnership effective immediately.

Circumstance \#2. On January 10, 2021, Beta instigates litigation in Nirvana Superior Court, seeking judicial dissolution of the partnership on the grounds that relations are irrevocably broken, that the other partners have in bad faith refused to allocate profits according to the relative value of each partner's contributions, and that it is impractical to continue in business together.

Circumstance \#3. Alpha dies in an industrial accident on January 7, 2021.
Circumstance \#4. Alpha and Charlie die in an industrial accident on January 7, 2021. On January 10, 2021, Beta delivers written notice to Delta that she is withdrawing from the partnership effective immediately.


[^0]: VII. "That thereafter the plaintiff violated the terms of said partnership agreement, in that he demanded a larger share of the income of the said partnership than he was entitled to receive under the terms of said partnership agreement; that the plaintiff was arrested for reckless driving and served a term in jail for said offense; that the plaintiff demanded that the defendants permit him to draw money for his own personal use out of the moneys held in escrow by the partnership; that the plaintiff spent a large amount of time during business hours in the Brass Rail Bar in Rapid City, South Dakota, and other bars, and neglected his duties in connection with the business of the said partnership. . . . That the plaintiff, by his actions hereinbefore set forth, has made it impossible to carry on the partnership."
