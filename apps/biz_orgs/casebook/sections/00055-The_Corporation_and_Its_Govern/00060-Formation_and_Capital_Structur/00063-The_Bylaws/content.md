MBCA §§ 2.05-2.07, 10.20
Delaware G.C.L. §§ 107-109
The bylaws are adopted by the incorporators or the board of directors at the first organizational meeting, although they can be (and often are) amended later on. The bylaws are the rules that govern the corporation on an everyday basis. They include the rules for director elections, the procedures for shareholder and board meetings, the rules for shareholder voting, and more. The bylaws must comply with state law and be consistent with the charter, but aside from these restrictions, incorporators have ample room to determine the corporation's internal governance rules and structure.

In addition, most states allow shareholders, in addition to the directors, to initiate a change in the corporation's bylaws. See, e.g., Delaware G.C.L. § 109. However, shareholders normally may not amend the bylaws to make ordinary business decisions or to establish corporate policies. That power belongs to the directors and can be taken away from them only by contrary provision in the articles of incorporation. See, e.g., Delaware G.C.L. § 141. There is some overlap and tension between these statutory provisions, which we will explore later in this chapter.

## PROBLEM 3-3

Assume that you are clerking part-time during law school for a local attorney who is a member of the State Bar Association, Corporate Act Revision Committee (CARC). Currently, your state's corporation code has a bylaw provision identical to MBCA §206 (a)-(b) and a bylaw amendment provision identical to MBCA § 10.20(a)-(b) (i). At the last CARC meeting, it was proposed that the committee should recommend to the legislature the adoption of Delaware G.C.L. §109 in lieu of the current bylaw provisions. Please prepare a memorandum advising your supervising attorney how they should vote on this proposal. Include in your memo examples of important governance matters that the corporation code allows to be accomplished in the bylaws.
