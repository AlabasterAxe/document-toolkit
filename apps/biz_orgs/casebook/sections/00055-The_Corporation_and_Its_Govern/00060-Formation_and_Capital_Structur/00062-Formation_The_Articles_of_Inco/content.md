MBCA §§ 2.01-2.06, 3.01, 8.01
Delaware G.C.L. §§101,102,361-368,141
The process of forming a corporation is fairly simple. The participants or their attorney creates a formation document, called the "articles of incorporation" in the MBCA and the "certificate of incorporation" in Delaware; we will use those terms interchangeably, or refer to this formation document as the corporation's "charter." The incorporator then files the charter with the appropriate state official in the chosen state, often a designee of the secretary of state, and the corporate existence begins. Thus, the articles of incorporation can be thought of as the corporation's birth certificate. However, the articles are also the corporation's constitution, determining basic financial and governance rights and obligations of managers and shareholders. After the articles are filed, there is usually an initial organizational meeting at which directors are elected, shares are issued in exchange for consideration that the corporation receives to undertake its business, and bylaws governing corporate procedures are adopted.

How would you as an attorney for the participants know what to include in the articles? The only constraints are that you must satisfy both the relevant state corporation code and your client. The state requirements are now fairly minimal. Only certain basic facts, such as the corporation's name, its registered office and agent for service of process, and the number of shares it is authorized to issue, must be included. However, do not let the relative simplicity of the incorporation process fool you into thinking that little thought or skill is required to create the initial articles. In fact, the relative rights of the initial participants and the relative power of directors and shareholders will be set near permanently at formation, and it is critically important to understand what the rules will be if no contrary provisions are inserted in the certificate of incorporation, and to know what non-mandatory items should be included in the charter to reflect and support the expectations of a particular group of participants.
