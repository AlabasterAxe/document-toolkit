If lawmakers are efficiency-minded, ^13 they will set default rules so as to maximize team members' ability to adapt to changed circumstances while minimizing their exposure to opportunism. To choose the appropriate rule, lawmakers must appreciate the difference between tailored, majoritarian, and penalty default rules.

Tailored rules are designed to give contracting parties the exact rule that they would themselves have chosen if they had been able to bargain costlessly over the matter in dispute. The availability of tailored results via ex post judging allows parties to avoid the costs of negotiating and executing a contract specifically covering all possible contingencies. However, providing tailored rules is a very problematic undertaking because of bounded rationality. How is a lawmaker to know what rule the particular parties would themselves select?

Any default rule could be said to be a tailored rule for parties that do not vary the rule by contract. But how do we know that their failure to vary was not the product of ignorance? How do we know that they did not simply trust each other's good faith and assume that the default rules would be adjusted as, and if, appropriate?

If the tailored result is to be provided by ex post judging, then bounds on the knowledge of judge and jury will make it difficult to determine the rule for which the parties would have bargained if transaction costs had been zero. Each party will have her own, perhaps opportunistic, account of the past. Each party will be represented by counsel who seeks to persuade the court of the merits of her own case.

Even if courts are able to arrive at "tailored" results, such an achievement may often be hollow. Society and the parties themselves bear substantial litigation costs in arriving at the tailored result. Since no two firms or set of team members are exactly the same, the availability of tailored results to be provided by ex post judging may discourage settlement of disputes because there is no "normal" rule that the parties can expect will apply to their unique case. Moreover, the availability of tailored rules to be provided by ex post judging may discourage ex ante contracting because it is not clear what rule is to be contracted around.

Majoritarian rules are designed to provide investors with the result that most similarly situated parties would prefer. By abandoning the search for tailored rules, lawmakers may make assumptions about the contracting needs of prospective members of a firm and provide rules that will suit a large number of them. Those who do not like the rules provided may vary them or simply choose another business form that has a more suitable set of rules.

Both tailored and majoritarian rules can be described as designed to provide contracting parties with the rule that they would have bargained for in a cost-free environment. However, advocates of tailored rules are speaking literally. They seek the result each particular litigant actually would have chosen. Advocates of majoritarian rules speak metaphorically. In essence they seek the rule that will best protect the rational ex ante expectations of parties similarly situated to the contracting parties.

Penalty default rules are designed to motivate one or more contracting parties to contract around the default. The goal of penalty defaults is not to economize on ex ante transaction costs. Instead, the goal is to force the parties to specify their own rules ex ante, instead of relying on a default rule provided by law. For example, a default rule might be intentionally set so as to penalize some or all of the parties as a means of forcing them to negotiate a rule that they prefer. Such a rule may be motivated by a desire to force the parties to share information with each other about their true intentions, rather than allowing the parties to simply adopt a set of standard form rules without revealing their true intentions. Or it may be motivated by lawmakers' desire to avoid the social cost of providing rules to parties via ex post judging, the cost of which is partially subsidized by society.

As you encounter the state-provided default rules for each form of business association, consider whether they can best be explained as an attempt to provide tailored, majoritarian, or penalty default rules. If possible, identify the factors that explain why the particular rule is so structured.
