When individuals choose to organize their business relationship by assuming roles within a firm, they do so with certain reasonable expectations in mind. It may be necessary to protect some of these expectations by contract, but it will not be necessary to draft contracts from scratch to cover every possible expectation or concern. Instead, by structuring the relationship as that between employer and employee, or as a corporation, partnership, or LLC, the parties receive the benefit of state-provided rules and dispute resolution processes. Thus, the employer-employee relationship, the corporation, the partnership, and the LLC are often described as state-provided standard form contracts.
