A variety of markets play an important role in the governance of firms and in how efficiency-minded lawmakers design the rules of business associations. These markets act to ensure that team members perform their services diligently and loyally, and otherwise to protect the reasonable expectations of investors in jointly owned firms. In so doing they make it less necessary for team members to engage in costly private ordering and make it less necessary for lawmakers to intercede.

The product market. Firms compete against each other in the production and sale of goods and services. If team members perform without sufficient skill and diligence, the firm will be at a competitive disadvantage. If the lack of skill and diligence is extreme, the firm may actually go out of existence.

The capital market. From time to time firms need to raise additional capital. To do so, they must compete with other firms that also seek capital. Prospective capital providers will seek the best return on their investment. Firms that are not well run will find that their costs of capital, in the form of interest charges, for example, are higher than the costs of efficiently run companies.

The national securities markets. The ownership rights (commonly called "stock") of most larger firms will be frequently traded in one or more of our national securities exchanges. These markets provide liquidity to investors by permitting them a rapid and near costless means of buying or selling their investments. As discussed in more detail in Chapter 3, these markets are thought to provide a constantly changing, accurate measure of the relative value of publicly traded firms and, by extension, an accurate measure of the value of their managers. To the extent that this is true, the need for judicial and regulatory checks on managers' conduct may be lessened.

The labor markets (including the market for managerial services). Most individuals realize the value of their human capital by selling their services in the labor market. Once they obtain employment, they cooperatively compete with other employees for various rewards, including the good reputations that will make it possible to advance within the firm or change jobs. If an employee is not considered to be diligent and loyal, he is unlikely to advance within the firm and is unlikely to receive good evaluations while employed or good recommendations upon departing. If his performance is sufficiently unacceptable, he may be discharged from the firm-imposing a costly reputational mark. But even if a team member is not identified by other team members as a slacker or worse, the team member's reputation may suffer if the firm, as a whole, is doing poorly.

Thus, the discipline of the labor markets may significantly reduce the need for ex ante contracting or the setting up of costly monitoring systems. For senior executives, this discipline is supplemented by the valuations made by the stock markets. Moreover, the reputational costs imposed by exposure as a negligent or dishonest team member may deter such conduct more effectively than fear of legal action.
