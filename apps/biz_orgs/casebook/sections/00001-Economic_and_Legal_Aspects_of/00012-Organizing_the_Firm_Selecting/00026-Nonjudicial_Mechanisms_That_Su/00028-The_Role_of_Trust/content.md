Trust and trustworthiness are factors that economists generally leave out in analyzing why firms serve, or can be structured to serve, the interests of team members better than organization via contracts between autonomous producers. Consider the comments of Professors Blair and Stout:

Social scientists have long argued that evolution can favor the development of a capacity for altruism in social organisms such as homo sapiens. This is because "irrationally" cooperative behavior within a particular group (including but not limited to trust and trustworthiness) often enhances the group's overall welfare. If the group does well, members of the group on average also do well. . . .

For similar reasons, cooperative behavior can be an important factor in the evolution not just of social organisms but also of social institutions. This is because groups whose members cooperate with each other can often thrive and grow at the expense of groups whose members do not cooperate. Social institutions that can promote and support trust among their participants can, as a result, have an evolutionary advantage over institutions that cannot.

Margaret M. Blair \& Lynn A. Stout, Trust, Trustworthiness, and the Behavioral Foundations of Corporation Law, 149 Pa. L. Rev. 1735, 1753-1754 (2001). How best to foster trust between employees and the entrepreneur in the classic firm, and between all participants in the more complex publicly traded firm, is obviously a key issue for both lawmakers and business planners.
