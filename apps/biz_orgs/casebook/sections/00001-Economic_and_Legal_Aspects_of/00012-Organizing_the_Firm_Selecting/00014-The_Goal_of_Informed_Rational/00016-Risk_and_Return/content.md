In comparing investment options, individuals attempt to determine the likely return from alternative investment choices. Financial theorists describe this process as a determination and comparison of "expected return." For some investments a rational person might foresee only one possible outcome. In such cases, the one foreseeable outcome is also the expected return from the investment. But for most investments there will be a range of possible outcomes. The expected return for these investments is determined by first multiplying each possible return by its probability, and by then summing these products.

For example, as hypothesized above, Sharon is considering three investment options. Alternatives 1 and 2 have different promised outcomes: Alternative 1 promises to pay Sharon $216,000 in one year, while Alternative 2 promises to pay Sharon $240,000 in one year. Under the assumptions outlined below, however, each of these investments has an expected return of $216,000.

While Alternatives 1 and 2 have the same expected return, Alternative 2 is "riskier" than Alternative 1 (which, in fact, would be described as a "risk-free" investment). As used here, "risk" means the degree to which the various possible outcomes will differ from the expected return. When the range of possible returns is zero, as in Alternative 1, the investment is risk-free. If Sharon purchases the Atomic Energy Corporation bonds, she runs a greater risk of receiving less than the expected return. On the other hand, the Atomic Energy Corporation bonds hold out the promise of a higher return than the U.S. Government bonds 90 percent of the time. Thus, risk is not necessarily bad, for with it comes the chance of greater reward.

Whether Sharon will prefer Alternative 1 or 2 depends on her taste or preference for risk. To some extent that preference may be a deeply ingrained behavioral characteristic over which Sharon has no control. Nonetheless, Sharon's risk preference is likely to be affected by the magnitude of a particular risk in relation to her existing wealth, and by the effect of this new investment on the riskiness of her existing portfolio.

Investors are generally characterized as "risk averse," "risk neutral," or "risk preferring." If Sharon is risk averse, then she will prefer the risk-free government bonds to the riskier corporate bonds. If Sharon is risk neutral, then she will be indifferent to a choice between Alternatives 1 and 2. Each promises the same return, and, since Sharon is risk neutral, she is unaffected by the greater risk presented by Alternative 2. If Sharon is risk preferring, then she will choose Alternative 2, gambling in effect that she will avoid the 10 percent chance of no return and receive the greater return promised, but not guaranteed, by Alternative 2.

An investor's risk preference will likely differ according to the circumstances. For example, if a relatively small amount is at stake, normally risk-averse individuals may actually be risk preferring, or at least less risk averse. A good example is a $1 lottery ticket. Many normally risk-averse investors might prefer lottery ticket A, which has one chance in a thousand of paying $600, to lottery ticket B, which has one chance in two of paying $1.20, even though both tickets have an expected return of $0.60. Likewise, Sharon is likely to have a greater taste for risk if the $200,000 she is investing is but a small part of her wealth than if she is investing a significant portion of her money capital.

Risk-averse investors often minimize risk by diversifying their portfolios. For example, suppose that Sharon has a total of $400,000 in money capital - the recently inherited $200,000 and a $200,000 investment in bonds of United Airlines Corporation. Furthermore, assume that the United Airlines bonds and the Atomic Energy Corporation bonds Sharon is considering buying have an identical expected return and riskiness. Finally, assume that the events that will cause either of these bonds to deliver a $0 payout can be identified and will not overlap. In such circumstances, a risk-averse Sharon would actually prefer Alternative 2 because such investment will decrease the overall riskiness of her portfolio.

If a $0 return occurs with respect to Sharon's investment in United Airlines bonds, it will be partially offset by a $240,000 return on the Atomic Energy Corporation bonds. If, instead, Sharon invests her inherited funds in U.S. Government bonds (Alternative 1), a $0 return on the United Airlines bonds will be offset by only the $216,000 return promised by Alternative 1. In the described circumstances, Alternative 2 is actually a less risky investment for Sharon than Alternative 1, the so-called risk-free investment.

In technical terms, Sharon is able to achieve a less risky portfolio by diversifying her holdings so that the range of possible outcomes varies less from the expected return - or mean of possible outcomes - than before. In other words, the more diversified the portfolio becomes, the less will be the possible disparity between actual and expected total returns.

Of course, Sharon will only pursue a portfolio diversification strategy if she is risk averse. Moreover, such a strategy depends for its success on being able to discover that the events that will cause one investment to produce a lower-than-expected return will cause another investment to produce a higher-than-expected return.

The foregoing analysis draws on Sharon's options for investing her money capital. However, the same analysis is appropriate for human capital investments. Sharon must not only consider the expected return from various uses of her human capital but also the riskiness of such paths. Her current job may offer a lower expected return on her human capital than does the contemplated venture with Jake (Alternative 3), but it also may offer a much more certain return. Moreover, since it is impossible to own another human being, it will be difficult for Sharon to diversify against risks inherent in certain uses of her human capital.
