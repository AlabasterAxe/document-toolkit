## Delaware G.C.L ยง 144

On February 17, 2025, Delaware State Senator Bryan Townsend introduced Senate Bill 21, containing an extensive set of controversial amendments to the Delaware General Corporation Law. The bill was quickly adopted by the Delaware legislature and signed into law by Governor Meyer in March 2025. A primary catalyst for the amendments was negative reaction from the business community to Delaware's jurisprudence on controlling shareholders. In particular, cases like Tornetta v. Musk had generated concern from the business community about who would count as a controlling shareholder and whether fundamental conflict transactions should be treated the same as more mundane ones (such as those involving routine executive compensation payments).
With respect to these controlling-shareholder concerns, Senate Bill 21 altered Section 144 in several key respects. First, the amendments expanded the scope of Section 144 beyond the voidability of conflicted transactions, providing that its cleansing standards would eliminate equitable relief or damages if used. Second, the amendments made clear that the statutory cleansing mechanisms provided in Section 144 would apply not only to director and officer conflict transactions, but also those involving controlling shareholders. Regarding controlling shareholder transactions, the statute provided different treatment based on the type of transaction at issue. For going private transactions involving a controller (the subject of Chapter 7), the use of both cleansing standards (defined as a majority vote of the informed and uncoerced disinterested shareholders and an informed and disinterested board committee composed of at least two directors) would render the transaction ineligible for equitable relief against the controller or managers. All other controlling shareholder transactions could be cleansed using a single mechanism-a departure from Delaware judicial precedent, which had treated going private decisions the same as other controller transactions. Importantly, the amendments facially support the view that cleansing votes may "ratify" conduct at any point, perhaps even after a Court of Chancery determination that the defendants have failed to prove fairness.

Finally, the amendments provided a bright-line test for controlling shareholders: It specified that a shareholder would be a controller only if the shareholder owns or controls a majority of the voting shares or owns or controls at least one-third of the outstanding voting shares plus wields managerial authority equivalent to a majority owner. Therefore, the statute overturned previous Delaware case law that had deemed shareholders like Elon Musk to be controllers with far less than 33 percent of the outstanding shares. It also eliminated the concept of "transaction-specific control" that had cropped up in Tornetta and the cases that proceeded it.

For an initial analysis of the moment in Delaware that proceeded these controversial amendments, consider the following:

Few moments in Delaware's storied corporate history have arrived quite like this one. All at once, we're seeing a broad legislative package that cuts across foundational doctrines . . . and does so with a speed and scope that contrasts starkly with the state's long tradition of incremental, consensusbased reform. For better or worse, the tide has turned, and these amendments are poised to reshape the very equilibrium that has made Delaware the unrivaled home for U.S. incorporations.

At first blush, the motive is straightforward: Some argue that Delaware needs to respond aggressively to a mounting fear of "Delaware exit," a scenario in which founder-led or controllerdominated firms, chafing under perceived judicial scrutiny, might pick up their charters and reincorporate elsewhere.

The impetus for that fear is not wholly imagined. Judges have recently shown a willingness to look deeply into sensitive transactions and demand robust procedural compliance, especially when dealing with controlling stockholders. High-profile rulings-and direct judicial engagements with the legislature - have rattled some corners of the defense bar. Whether "DExit" is truly imminent or just rumor, Delaware evidently feels compelled to lay all its cards on the table in one sweeping legislative flourish.

That flourish, however, reaches beyond a mere restoration of "balance" or "predictability." It systematically recalibrates entire fairness for controller deals [and] narrows which transactions even count as controller conflicts . . . that, for some observers, will push Delaware law further toward the side of managers and controlling stockholders.
Most striking of all is the speed with which this is happening-circumventing the usual measured processes of the Delaware Bar's Corporation Law Council and the typical stakeholder buy-in. . . .

If these new reforms, ironically, diminish judicial oversight . . . , they might inadvertently sap what truly sets Delaware apart: a flexible, nuanced, judge-made approach that refines fiduciary principles over time. What remains may be a more rigid, top-down code that invites further legislative tinkering every time dissatisfaction bubbles up.

Yet some will argue that this is precisely what the moment demands - perhaps rightly so. Controllers, especially those running high-profile tech or founder-led firms, have threatened to move elsewhere. Large law firms, attuned to that sentiment, are nudging the legislature to act. The fear is that if Delaware sits on its hands, high-innovation companies might find "friendlier" jurisdictions.

But that logic cuts both ways. Delaware's entire franchise relies on trust-that minority investors won't be trampled and that controversies will be resolved with sophisticated equity-based jurisprudence. If these reforms are seen as a step too far in curtailing minority or derivative suits, it could fracture that trust and open the door to alternative states (or even foreign jurisdictions) offering a more balanced environment. The result could be the very exodus the legislature had hoped to avoid.

Let's be clear: These amendments amount to a direct rebuke of the Delaware judiciary. They impose a legislative clampdown on the very judicial discretion that, for decades, has defined Delaware's distinctive brand of corporate governance. Critics of Chancery may celebrate the move, but in doing so they risk undermining Delaware's greatest asset: the feedback loop between sophisticated litigation and careful case-by-case refinement of fiduciary law.

Surrogating that organic development with rigid statutory definitions might yield nearterm comfort-narrower definitions of "controller," more lenient thresholds for cleansing con-flicts-but in the longer run, it's not obvious that a "check-the-box" system fosters the same sense of dynamic equilibrium that has underpinned Delaware's century-long hegemony. One wonders whether this legislative pivot might be the apex of a shift away from the state's tried-and-true formula, and thus the beginning of an unraveling.

# NOTES AND QUESTIONS 

1. Although amended Section 144's bright-line test for shareholder control cabined judicial discretion, it was in line with earlier Delaware jurisprudence. For example, in an earlier opinion discussing Tesla's decision to buy Solar City, the Delaware Supreme Court suggested in dicta that the controlling shareholder label should not apply to a shareholder that lacks "the voting power to elect directors, approve transactions, or . . . block transactions." In re Tesla Motors, Inc. Stockholder Litig., 298 A.3d 667, 699 n. 117 (Del. June 6, 2023). Chancellor McCormick's analysis went much further than this, relying in part on Musk's "superstar CEO" status. Nonetheless, an article authored by two former Delaware Supreme Court justices and a leading academic questioned this logic: "[The finding] that Musk was so talented and visionary that the company could not succeed without him-does not rationally imply that someone is a controlling stockholder. Being valuable to the company does not make an executive a controlling stockholder, nor does it implicate the . . . potential to use affirmative voting power to unseat directors and implement transactions that the minority stockholders do not like, and use blocking voting power to impede other transactions."

2. Return to the Tornetta case and imagine that amended Section 144 had been in effect at the time of the decision. Would it have changed the result in the case?
3. Consider the constituencies affected by the amendments and their possible reactions. If you were a corporate director, would you welcome these changes and why? What if you were a controlling shareholder? What if you were a minority shareholder?
4. Although the business community had reacted negatively to the Tornetta case and Tesla had successfully reincorporated to Texas in its wake, it is not clear that Delaware's dominance was seriously under threat at the time the amendments had passed. Consider the following:

For over a century, Delaware has led the corporate law landscape, though it has not been without competitors. States such as Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Virginia have attempted to rival Delaware, attracted by its significant tax revenue from incorporations. Today, Nevada emerges as a notable challenger, actively promoting "DExit"-a push for companies to leave Delaware. Consequently, this analysis primarily examines the choice between Delaware and Nevada.

Widespread discussion of the potential for mass DExit was triggered by recent criticisms from business leaders and prominent corporate lawyers. While such complaints have not yet triggered a mass exodus from Delaware, many firms are reportedly considering changing their corporate domicile. But is Delaware's dominance genuinely at risk? Are these just isolated incidents or signs of a broader trend? . . .

The data suggest two main conclusions. First, almost all reasons given for reincorporation seem implausible. If DExit becomes more frequent, plaintiff lawyers should scrutinize these disclosures, particularly focusing on enhanced liability protections for controllers, directors, and officers, suggesting possible conflicts of interest requiring entire fairness review. Second, the number of reincorporations from Delaware remains minimal compared to the vast number of new incorporations Delaware attracts annually. Given the strong inertia behind the initial incorporation decision and the weak drivers for DExit, it is unlikely to become widespread soon.
