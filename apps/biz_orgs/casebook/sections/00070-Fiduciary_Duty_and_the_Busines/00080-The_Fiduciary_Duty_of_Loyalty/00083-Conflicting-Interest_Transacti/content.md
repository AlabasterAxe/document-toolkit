## a. At Common Law

In the nineteenth century, common law courts were in substantial agreement that transactions between a corporation and one or more of its directors were void or voidable simply because a conflict of interest existed. Justice Field echoed the accepted rationale for this prohibition in Wardell v. Union Pacific R.R., 103 U.S. 651, 658 (1880):

It is among the rudiments of the law that the same person cannot act for himself and at the same time, with respect to the same matter, as the agent of another whose interests are conflicting. Thus a person cannot be a purchaser of property and at the same time the agent of the vendor. The two positions impose different obligations, and their union would at once raise a conflict between interest and duty; and, "constituted as humanity is, in the majority of cases duty would be overborne in the struggle." . . . The law, therefore, will always condemn the transactions of a party on his own behalf when, in respect of the matter concerned, he is the agent of others, and will relieve against them whenever their enforcement is seasonably resisted. Directors of corporations, and all persons who stand in a fiduciary relation to other parties, and are clothed with power to act for them, are subject to this rule; they are not permitted to occupy a position which will conflict with the interest of parties they represent and are bound to protect. They cannot, as agents or trustees, enter into contracts on behalf of those for whom they are appointed to act, and then personally participate in the benefits.

As the complexity and interconnection of American business increased, director conflicting-interest transactions became an accepted business reality. Judicial views evolved accordingly. By the twentieth century, most common law courts no longer viewed conflicting-interest transactions as automatically void or voidable. However, courts were quick to void a conflicting-interest transaction if the substantive terms of the transaction were found unfair, or, even if such terms were found fair, if the benefiting directors had in any way breached their obligation to disclose fully all relevant facts to the corporation, including, of course, the fact of their interest in the subject matter. The following case is typical of the early twentieth-century judicial approach, an approach that undergirds current jurisprudence.

# Globe Woolen Co. v. Utica Gas \& Electric Co. <br> Court of Appeals of New York, 1918 <br> 121 N.E. 378 

Cardozo, Judge.
The plaintiff, a corporation, sues to compel the specific performance of contracts to supply electric current to its mills. The defendant, also a corporation, answers that the contracts were made under the dominating influence of a common director; that their terms are unfair, and their consequences oppressive; and that hence they may not stand. A referee has sustained the defense; and the Appellate Division, with some modification, has affirmed his judgment.

The plaintiff is the owner of two mills in the city of Utica. One is for the manufacture of worsteds, and the other for that of woolens. The defendant generates and sells electricity for light and power. For many years John F. Maynard has been the plaintiff's chief stockholder, its president, and a member of its board of directors. He has also been a director of the defendant, and chairman of its executive committee. He received a single share of the defendant's stock to qualify him for office. He returned the share at once, and he has never held another. His property interest in the plaintiff is large. In the defendant he has none.

The history of the transaction may be briefly stated. At the beginning the mills were run by steam, and the plant was antiquated and inadequate. As early as 1903 one Greenidge, then the superintendent and later the general manager of the defendant's electrical department, suggested to Mr. Maynard the substitution of electric power. Nothing came of the suggestion then. Mr. Maynard was fearful that the cost of equipment would be too great unless the defendant would guarantee a saving in the cost of operation. None the less a change was felt to be important, and from time to time the subject was taken up anew. In 1904 there was an investigation of the power plant by Greenidge and a written report of its condition. For this service, though he was still in the defendant's employ, he was paid by Mr. Maynard. In 1905 the substitution of electricity was again considered, but dismissed as impracticable because of the plaintiff's continued insistence upon a guaranty of saving. In the fall of 1906 the project was renewed. It was renewed by Maynard and Greenidge, who debated it between themselves. There were other officers of the defendant who knew that the project was afoot, but they took no part in formulating it. Maynard still insisted on a guaranty of saving. The plaintiff's books were thrown open to Greenidge, who calculated for himself the cost of operation with steam and the probable cost with electricity. When the investigation was over, a contract was closed. It took the form of letters exchanged between Greenidge and Maynard. In the letter signed by Greenidge, the defendant proposed to supply the plaintiff's worsted mill with electricity at a maximum rate of $.0104 per kilowatt hour, and to guarantee that the cost for heat and light and power would show a saving each month of $300 as compared with the cost for the corresponding month in the year previous to the change. There was to be a trial period ending July 1, 1907. Then, at the plaintiff's option, the contract was to run for five years, with a privilege of renewal for a like term. In a letter signed by Maynard on October 22, 1906, the plaintiff accepted the proposal. At once the defendant made preparations to install the new equipment. Six weeks later, on December 1, 1906, Mr. Maynard laid the contract before the defendant's executive committee. He went to the meeting with Mr. Greenidge. The contract was read. Mr. Lewis, the vice president, asked Mr. Greenidge what the rate would be, and was told about $.0104 per kilowatt hour. Mr. Beardsley, another director, asked whether the contract was a profitable one for the company, and was told by Mr. Greenidge that it was. Mr. Maynard kept silent. A resolution was moved and carried that the contract be ratified. Mr. Maynard presided at the meeting, and put the resolution, but was excused from voting.

This settled the problem of power for the worsted mill. Attention was next directed to the woolen mill. Again Mr. Maynard and Mr. Greenidge put the project through unaided. In February, 1907, letters, similar in most things to the earlier ones, were exchanged. The guaranty of saving for this mill as for the other was to be $300 a month. There were, however, new provisions to the effect that the contract should apply to "current used for any purposes in any extensions or additions to the mills," and that in case of shortage of electricity the plaintiff should be preferred in service over all other customers except the city of Utica. At a meeting of the executive committee held February 11, 1907, this contract was ratified. The statement was made by Mr. Greenidge, in the presence of Mr. Maynard, that it was practically a duplicate of the first contract, except that it related to another mill. Nothing was said about the new provisions. Mr. Maynard presided and put the resolution, but did not vote.

At a cost to the plaintiff of more than $21,000 the requisite changes in the mills were made, and the new power was supplied. It quickly appeared that the defendant had made a losing contract; but only gradually did the extent of the loss, its permanence, and its causes unfold themselves. Greenidge had miscalculated the amount of steam that would be required to heat the dye houses. The expenditure for coal mounted by leaps and bounds. The plaintiff dyed more yarn and less slubbing than before. But the dyeing of yarn takes twice as much heat as that of slubbing, and thus doubles the cost of fuel. These and like changes in the output of the mills had not been foreseen by Greenidge, and Maynard had not warned of them. In 1909 the defendant became alarmed at the mounting loss. Various tests and palliatives were suggested and adopted, but there was no change in the result. Finally, in February, 1911, the defendant gave notice of rescission. At that time it had supplied the plaintiff with electricity worth $69,500.75 if paid for at the maximum rate fixed by the contract, and $60,000 if paid for at the lowest rate charged to any customer in Utica. Yet not only had it received nothing, but it owed the plaintiff under its guaranty $11,721.41. The finding is that a like loss prolonged to the end of the term would amount to $300,000.

These are the contracts which the courts below have annulled. The referee annulled them absolutely. The Appellate Division imposed the condition that the defendant reimburse the plaintiff for the cost of installation. The defendant makes no complaint of the condition. The plaintiff, appealing, stands upon its bargain.

We think the evidence supports the conclusion that the contracts are voidable at the election of the defendant. The plaintiff does not deny that this would be true if the dual director had voted for their adoption. Munson v. Syracuse, G. \& C. R.R. Co., 103 N.Y. 58,8 N.E. 355 . But the argument is that by refusing to vote he shifted the responsibility to his associates, and may reap a profit from their errors. One does not divest oneself so readily of one's duties as trustee. The refusal to vote has, indeed, this importance: It gives to the transaction the form and presumption of propriety, and requires one who would invalidate it to probe beneath the surface. Davids v. Davids, 135 App. Div. 206, 209, 120 N. Y. Supp. 350. But "the great rule of law" (Andrews, J., in Munson v. Syracuse, G. \& C. R.R. Co., supra, 103 N.Y. at page 73, 8 N.E. at page 358) which holds a trustee to the duty of constant and unqualified fidelity is not a thing of forms and phrases. A dominating influence may be exerted in other ways than by a vote. Adams v. Burke, 201 Ill. 395, 66 N.E. 235; Davids v. Davids, supra. A beneficiary, about to plunge into a ruinous course of dealing, may be betrayed by silence as well as by the spoken word.

The trustee is free to stand aloof, while others act, if all is equitable and fair. He cannot rid himself of the duty to warn and to denounce, if there is improvidence or oppression, either apparent on the surface, or lurking beneath the surface, but visible to his practiced eye. Davids v. Davids, supra; Crocker v. Cumberland Mining \& Milling Co., 31 S.D. 137, 146, 139 N.W. 783; Fort Payne v. Hill, 174 Mass. 224, 54 N.E. 532; Wyman v. Bowman, 127 Fed. 257, 274, 62 C.C.A. 189.

There was an influence here, dominating, perhaps, and surely potent and persuasive, which was exerted by Mr. Maynard from the beginning to the end. In all the stages of preliminary treaty he dealt with a subordinate, who looked up to him as to a superior, and was alert to serve his pleasure. There was no clean-cut cleavage in those stages between his conflicting offices and agencies. Hoyle v. Plattsburgh \& M. R.R. Co., 54 N.Y. 314, 328, 329, 13 Am. Rep. 595. No label identified the request of Mr. Maynard, the plaintiff's president, as something separate from the advice of Mr. Maynard, the defendant's chairman. Superior and subordinate together framed a contract, and together closed it. It came before the executive committee as an accomplished fact. The letters had been signed and delivered. Work had been begun. All that remained was a ratification, which may have been needless, and which, even if needful, took the aspect of a mere formality. There was some attempt to show that Mr. Lewis, the vice president, had seen the letters before. The testimony of Mr. Greenidge indicates the contrary. In support of the judgment, we accept his testimony as true. That the letters had been seen by others, there is not even a pretense. The members of the committee, hearing the contract for the first time, knew that it had been framed by the chairman of the meeting. They were assured in his presence that it was just and equitable. Faith in his loyalty disarmed suspicion.

There was, then, a relation of trust reposed, of influence exerted, of superior knowledge on the one side and legitimate dependence on the other. Sage v. Culver, 147 N.Y. 241, 247, 41 N.E. 513; Davids v. Davids, supra. At least, a finding that there was this relation has evidence to sustain it. A trustee may not cling to contracts thus won, unless their terms are fair and just. Crocker v. Cumberland Mining \& Milling Co., supra, and cases there cited; Dongan v. MacPherson, 1902 A.C. 197, 200; Thompson on Corp. 1228, 1231. His dealings with his beneficiary are "viewed with jealousy by the courts, and may be set aside on slight grounds." Twin Lick Oil Co. v. Marbury, 91 U.S. 587, 588 ( 23 L. Ed. 328). He takes the risk of an enforced surrender of his bargain if it turns out to be improvident. There must be candor and equity in the transaction, and some reasonable proportion between benefits and burdens.

The contracts before us do not survive these tests. The unfairness is startling, and the consequences have been disastrous. The mischief consists in this: That the guaranty has not been limited by a statement of the conditions under which the mills are to be run. No matter how large the business, no matter how great the increase in the price of labor or of fuel, no matter what the changes in the nature or the proportion of the products, no matter even though there be extensions of the plant, the defendant has pledged its word that for ten years there will be a saving of $600 a month, $300 for each mill, $7,200 a year. As a result of that pledge it has supplied the plaintiff with electric current for nothing, and owes, if the contract stands, about $11,000 for the privilege. These elements of unfairness Mr. Maynard must have known, if indeed his knowledge be material. He may not have known how great the loss would be. He may have trusted to the superior technical skill of Mr. Greenidge to compute with approximate accuracy the comparative cost of steam and electricity. But he cannot have failed to know that he held a one-sided contract which left the defendant at his mercy. He was not blind to the likelihood that in a term of ten years there would be changes in the business. The swiftness with which some of the changes followed permits the inference that they were premeditated. There was a prompt increase in the proportion of yarns as compared with slubbing when the guaranty of saving charged the defendant with the greater cost of fuel. But, whether these and other changes were premeditated or not, at least they were recognized as possible. With that recognition, no word of warning was uttered to Greenidge or to any of the defendant's officers. There slumbered within these contracts a potency of profit which the plaintiff neither ignored in their making nor forgot in their enforcement.

It is no answer to say that this potency, if obvious to Maynard, ought also to have been obvious to other members of the committee. They did not know, as he did, the likelihood or the significance of changes in the business. There was need, too, of reflection and analysis before the dangers stood revealed. For the man who framed the contracts, there was opportunity to consider and to judge. His fellow members, hearing them for the first time, and trustful of his loyalty, would have no thought of latent peril. That they had none is sufficiently attested by the fact that the contracts were approved. There was inequality, therefore, both in knowledge and in the opportunity for knowledge. It is not important in such circumstances whether the trustee foresaw the precise evils that developed. The inference that he did might not be unsupported by the evidence. But the indefinite possibilities of hardship, the opportunity in changing circumstances to wrest unlooked-for profits and impose unlookedfor losses, these must have been foreseen. Foreseen or not, they were there, and their presence permeates the contracts with oppression and inequity.

We hold, therefore, that the refusal to vote does not nullify as of course an influence and predominance exerted without a vote. We hold that the constant duty rests on a trustee to seek no harsh advantage to the detriment of his trust, but rather to protest and renounce if through the blindness of those who treat with him he gains what is unfair. And, because there is evidence that in the making of these contracts that duty was ignored, the power of equity was fittingly exercised to bring them to an end.

Judgment affirmed.

# b. The Intersection of the Common Law and Typical Conflicting-Interest Statutes 

MBCA §§ 1.43, 8.60-8.63
New York Bus. Corp. L. § 713
Restatement (Third) Law of Agency § 8.01
As the common law moved away from the position that director conflictinginterest transactions were automatically void, state legislatures began enacting director conflicting-interest transaction statutes that sought to further insulate corporations from shareholder litigation aimed at rescinding conflict-tainted transactions. These statutes recognized that the complexities and interconnections of modern business made it both inefficient and unjust to use judicial oversight as the only mechanism by which a director's transaction with her corporation could, in modern parlance, be cleansed of any conflicting-interest taint.

The most influential of the early director-conflicting-interest statutes was California Civ. Code § 311. Eventually, the California model was copied by the Model Business Corporation Act, by Delaware, and by most other states. The rationale and nature of these provisions was straightforward - to severely curtail the circumstances under which a director conflicting-interest transaction would be void or voidable. In essence, traditional conflicting-interest statutes provide that no director conflictinginterest transaction shall be void or voidable solely by reason of the conflict if the transaction is (1) authorized by a majority of the disinterested directors, or (2) approved in good faith by the shareholders, or (3) fair to the corporation at the time authorized. Such statutes left significant gaps that common law courts continue to address, including the possible reach of the statute beyond the narrow confines of negating voidness or voidability.

More recently, some influential states, including Texas and Delaware, have broadened their conflicting-interest statutes to cover both director transactions and officer transactions. For the majority of states which limit their conflicting-interest statutes to director transactions, officer transactions are covered by the common law of agency which provides less clarity as to the extent of an officer's responsibilities or the mechanisms by which an officer transaction may be cleansed of any conflicting-interest taint.
In 1988, the MBCA was amended, adding a new Subchapter F to address director conflicting-interest transactions. The new provisions emphasized certainty and predictability rather than judicial oversight. The Subchapter F approach has three features. First, MBCA §8.60 defines director conflicting-interest transactions with substantially greater precision than traditional conflicting-interest statutes. Second, MBCA §8.61 (a) instructs courts that transactions falling outside of the statutory definition "may not be enjoined, set aside, or give rise to an award of damages or other sanctions . . . because a director of the corporation, or any person with whom or which he has a personal, economic, or other association, has an interest in the transaction." Put another way, transactions falling outside of the statutory definition in MBCA §8.61 do not expose an "interested" director to any special duty of candor or fair dealing, and therefore courts cannot grant relief based on an alleged violation of those duties. Finally, MBCA §§8.61 (b), 8.62 , and 8.63 provide that a conflictinginterest transaction may not be voided as a result of such conflict if the transaction is ratified by "qualified directors," or by the vote of "qualified shares," or is fair to the corporation. These new rules define with particularity the individuals who may and may not participate in a ratification or authorization of a conflicting-interest transaction.

The Subchapter F conflicting-interest provisions, while seeking to provide greater certainty, still leave substantial room for judicial determinations and, thus, substantial room for continuing uncertainty and litigation. MBCA §8.61 (b) describes the circumstances under which a court will not grant relief solely on the grounds that a conflict of interest taints the transaction. As the official comment to §8.61 emphasizes, "if the transaction is vulnerable on some other ground, Subchapter F does not make it less so for having passed through the procedures of Subchapter F." Subchapter F does not tell us what those other grounds are or what role, if any, unfairness plays in a transaction ratified by disinterested shareholders or directors.

As you work through the problems below, reflect on the advantages and disadvantages offered by the MBCA and traditional conflicting-interest statutes, such as that now in effect in New York. If either had been in effect in New York in the early 1900s, how would it have changed the negotiation and approval of the contract between Global Woolen and Utica Electric, and how would it likely have affected the content of the contracts ultimately agreed to by the two firms?

# PROBLEM 4-7 

Joan is one of the nine directors of Wallvision, Inc. Joan owns 100,000 Wallvision shares, constituting approximately 0.5 percent of the total outstanding. Joan is not a current or former Wallvision employee. Recently Wallvision's board of directors approved a plan to replace all of the company's current desktop printers with a much smaller number of more powerful computers to be utilized in a new centralized print delivery system at each of Wallvision's offices worldwide. At the same time, the board approved a long-term purchase, installation, and maintenance contract with PRINT, Inc. (PRINT) that will cost Wallvision $6,000,000 annually over the initial ten years of the contract. Consider whether the contract with PRINT constitutes a conflicting-interest transaction under New York Bus. Corp. L. § 713, under a statute similar to New York's that also covers officer transactions, or under the MBCA, if Joan has any of the following relationships with PRINT:
a. Joan is the CEO of PRINT.
b. Joan is a director of PRINT.
c. Joan owns 10,000 PRINT shares.
d. Joan's half-sister, Beth, is PRINT's CEO; Beth is 20 years older than Joan, and the half-siblings have a frosty relationship.
e. Joan is the CEO of Asparagus, Inc.; Jack Spratt is the controlling shareholder of both Asparagus and PRINT.
f. Joan's daughter, Jill, is in a long-term relationship with PRINT's Vice President of Sales, Susan Gleason. Susan and Jill own a house together, and Susan spends lavishly supporting Jill's efforts, so far unsuccessful, to breed, train, and race horses. Prior to Susan and Jill's relationship, Joan supported Jill's horse-related endeavors.

How would your analysis of the above be affected if Joan were Wallvision's Chief Financial Officer, but not a director?

# PROBLEM 4-8 

Suppose that in each of the circumstances described in Problem 4-7, Joan discloses the potential conflict to the full board. The board has asked you, the company's General Counsel, for advice on how to handle the approval of the transaction so that it will not be subject to effective challenge in a shareholder-instigated lawsuit. The board expresses a strong preference to avoid the cost and delay of submitting the transaction to the shareholders for approval. What would you advise the board if MBCA Chapter 8 Subchapter F is the governing provision? Would your advice change if Delaware G.C.L. §144 is the governing provision? As general counsel faced with advising the board on this matter, would you prefer that the governing provision be MBCA Subchapter F or New York Bus. Corp. L. § 713?

## PROBLEM 4-9

Suppose that in each of the circumstances described in Problem 4-7, the Wallvision board takes no special steps to insulate the transaction from conflicting-interest challenges. Subsequently a shareholder lawsuit is filed identifying the purported conflict of interest and asserting that the transaction is unfair to the corporation because the existing laptop computers still have a significant useful life. Assuming nothing else is pled as to the unfairness of the transaction, will this complaint survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim?
# PROBLEM 4-10 

Dan is one of nine directors of Wallvision, Inc. He owns 10,000 Wallvision shares constituting less than 0.1 percent of the total outstanding. Dan is not a current or former Wallvision employee. Recently Wallvision approved its CEO's recommendation to move Wallvision's principal executive offices from Metropolis to Styx City. The move will take several years and will require the company to sell numerous properties in Metropolis and acquire or lease replacements in Styx City. Dan is the CEO and controlling shareholder of Styx Properties, Inc., which owns or otherwise controls a substantial portion of the high-end commercial real estate properties in Styx that will likely be attractive to Wallvision. It is also likely that commercial property values in Styx City will increase as a result of Wallvision's planned relocation. Is Wallvision's decision to relocate its headquarters a conflicting-interest transaction under New York law or the MBCA? How would your analysis be affected if Dan purchased Styx Properties, Inc. only six months ago, shortly after Wallvision began debating the headquarters-relocation decision?
