Maffei v. Palkon<br>Supreme Court of Delaware, 2025 (En Banc)<br>2025 WL 384054

ValiHura, J.:
# INTRODUCTION 

Delaware is privileged to serve as the domicile for many of our nation's corporations and other business entities. But other states are eager to compete by promoting their respective corporate governance regimes. Nevada is one such state and has developed its own business court and statutes.

Here, directors, officers, and stockholders of Tripadvisor, Inc. ("Tripadvisor") and Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. ("Liberty TripAdvisor") have determined to change their corporate domiciles from Delaware to Nevada. But not all stockholders supported this decision - in fact, the transactions designed to effectuate this change (the "Conversions") would have been voted down without the Defendant-Controller Gregory Maffei's votes. Plaintiffs are stockholders who argue that the Conversions will provide non-ratable benefits in the form of reduced liability exposure to Defen-dants-a group comprised of Maffei, who is effectively the controller of Tripadvisor and Liberty TripAdvisor, as well as members of the boards of directors of both corporations. Accordingly, Plaintiffs argue that the Conversions should be reviewed under the entire fairness standard. Defendants vigorously dispute this contention and argue that the business judgment rule applies.

We granted interlocutory review following the Court of Chancery's denial of Defendants' motion to dismiss. The Court of Chancery held that Plaintiffs adequately alleged that Defendants will receive a non-ratable benefit in the form of reduced liability exposure and that the Complaint alleged facts supporting a reasonable inference that the Conversions were not entirely fair. Defendants dispute this conclusion and argue that they will not receive a non-ratable benefit and, accordingly, the business judgment rule applies. Thus, despite the vigorous debate about whether the variation of state corporate laws is vibrant competition among laboratories of democracy or a race-to-the-bottom of stockholder protections, the issue before us is a narrow one - which standard of review governs the decisions to approve the Conversions? . . .

## I. RELEVANT FACTUAL AND PROECEDURAL BACKGROUND

## A. THE PARTIES

Plaintiffs Below, Appellees, are Dennis Palkon and Herbert Williamson. Palkon is a purported stockholder of Tripadvisor, Inc., and Williamson is a purported stockholder of Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc.

Defendants Below, Appellants, are Gregory B. Maffei, Albert E. Rosenthaler, Matt Goldberg, Jay C. Hoag, Betsy Morgan, Greg O'Hara, Jeremy Philips, Trynka Shineman Blake, Jane Jie Sun, Robert S. Wisenthal, Larry E. Romrell, J. David Wargo, Michael J. Malone, Chris Mueller, and Christy Haubegger. Maffei serves on the board of Tripadvisor and is the CEO, President, and Chairman of Liberty TripAdvisor. The other defendants are members of either Tripadvisor's board of directors or Liberty TripAdvisor's board of directors. When Plaintiffs filed the action below, Maffei beneficially owned super-voting Series B common stock of Liberty TripAdvisor, constituting 43 percent of Liberty TripAdvisor's voting power. For the sake of their motion to dismiss and this appeal, Defendants do not dispute the allegation that Maffei controls Tripadvisor and Liberty TripAdvisor.

Nominal defendants below, Tripadvisor, Inc. and Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc., are Delaware corporations. Tripadvisor is headquartered in Massachusetts and operates the world's largest travel guidance platform. Liberty TripAdvisor is headquartered in Colorado and holds an approximately 21 percent economic interest and a 56 percent voting interest in Tripadvisor. . . .

# B. THE CONVERSION TRANSACTIONS 

## 1. Director Approval of Tripadvisor's Conversion

The Tripadvisor directors first discussed "reincorporating from Delaware to Nevada" in November 2022. Management materials circulated to the Board in advance of the meeting presented purported advantages of a conversion "including, but not limited to the following: Directors and officers of [Nevada corporations] may enjoy a higher level of protection against personal liability; Nevada has business courts that minimize the time, cost and risks of commercial litigation; and Nevada has lower taxes and fees." Management also noted that "Legal is evaluating the benefits against any potential issues or risks and the potential cost savings against the anticipated cost to re-incorporate and will report back to the Board."

The Board revisited the proposed Conversion in February 2023 as management emphasized the same purported legal advantages. Materials for the meeting included a presentation noting, among other things, that:

- "[T]he laws of Nevada would generally permit the Company to offer greater protection to its directors and officers."
- Even "in connection with a challenge to an interested party transaction with a controlling shareholder . . . [t]he Nevada . . . statutory business judgment rule, not the entire fairness standard, is the sole standard for any analysis involving fiduciary duty claims against corporate directors and officers in Nevada."
- "Delaware courts have significant expertise in dealing with corporate matters and have developed a substantial body of case law interpreting Delaware corporation law. In addition, the Delaware courts have a limited number of judges that hear corporate cases who are all well experienced in corporate law matters. Because Nevada case law concerning the effects of its statutes and regulations is more limited, and Nevada judges may have less experience in corporate law, the Company and its stockholders may experience less predictability in Nevada courts with respect to corporate matters."
- "[M]arket participants are familiar with the Delaware corporate law regime and may perceive Nevada laws as less developed or predictable."
- "Investors may perceive Nevada corporate law as less responsive to stockholder rights, which may deter certain investors from investing in a Nevada corporation and/or could lead to negative PR."

The Tripadvisor directors met again on March 23, 2023 to approve the Conversion. There, the Board reviewed a management presentation including [similar] points . . . .
The Tripadvisor Board approved the Conversion in substance following the discussion.

# 2. Director Approval of Liberty TripAdvisor's Conversion 

The Liberty TripAdvisor directors considered similar factors. Management's March 7, 2023 presentation to the directors included the following purported legal advantages of converting to a Nevada corporation:

- "Recent case law developments in Delaware, in particular with respect to conflicted controller and 'change of control' transactions, have increasingly emboldened plaintiffs' law firms to bring claims against directors and officers, significant stockholders and the company and have increased potential exposure for these parties";
- "Under Delaware law director liability cannot be eliminated if the court finds a breach of duty of loyalty and D\&O carriers often argue duty of loyalty claims are not insured";
- "Cases that are subject to 'entire fairness' review in Delaware (which requires the defendants to demonstrate that the price and process in a transaction were entirely fair) present a high bar and, because of the factual issues involved, it is often difficult for defendants to prevail in the preliminary stages of litigation";
- "Liberty Media [an affiliated public company for which Maffei serves as CEO], its service companies and certain of their portfolio companies have experienced these developments, having been involved in at least 8 stockholder lawsuits in Delaware since 2012 ( 5 of which were brought in the last 5 years) which have resulted in substantial time and expense to defend and resolve";
- "Management believes Nevada law generally provides greater protection from liability to the Company and its D\&Os than Delaware law";
- "Nevada law eliminates the individual liability of both officers and directors to the company, its stockholders or its creditors for damages as a result of a breach of fiduciary duty unless the breach involved intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law and unless a company's articles of incorporation provide for greater liability";
- "Nevada does not follow Revlon duties (duty to get the best price reasonably available in a sale), and instead permits consideration of 'other constituencies' by statute[.]"

The presentation acknowledged the potential litigation risk of pursuing this Conversion. The materials noted that Delaware plaintiffs may sue Liberty TripAdvisor's directors for "breach of fiduciary duty for allowing alleged controlling shareholder misconduct to take advantage of Nevada legal framework for self-interest[.]" The presentation also noted uncertainty regarding "Post-Reincorporation Nevada Litigation," stating that "notwithstanding that it is contemplated that the Nevada charter will require that 'internal actions' be brought exclusively in Nevada state courts, there is uncertainty as to whether Delaware and federal courts would enforce that requirement."
After discussion, Liberty TripAdvisor management agreed to continue to pursue the proposed reincorporation and to follow up with the Board for formal approval at a later date. On April 5, 2023, the Liberty TripAdvisor Board approved the Conversion by unanimous written consent.

# 3. The Stockholder Votes on the Conversions 

Both corporations distributed proxy statements in advance of the stockholder votes on the Conversions [the adequacy of which has not been challenged]

Assuming Maffei and Liberty TripAdvisor voted all their shares in favor, only 5.4 percent of minority Tripadvisor and 30.4 percent of Liberty TripAdvisor's minority stockholders voted for the Conversions. Therefore, the Conversions would not have been approved without the votes of Maffei and Liberty TripAdvisor. However, with Maffei and Liberty TripAdvisor's votes included, the Conversions were approved by a majority of each corporation's voting power at their respective annual meetings in June 2023.

## C. PROCEEDINGS IN THE COURT OF CHANCERY . . .

3. The Court of Chancery's Analysis . . .
b. The Court of Chancery Found That the Conversions May Convey a Non-Ratable Benefit to Defendants The court observed that "[u]nder Delaware law, a controller or other fiduciary obtains a non-ratable benefit when a transaction materially reduces or eliminates the fiduciary's risk of liability." . . .

## c. The Court of Chancery Rejected Defendants' Argument That Applying the Entire Fairness Standard Is Not Feasible

The court began by outlining how it viewed the entire fairness standard. The court criticized Defendants' argument that it would not be feasible to apply entire fairness. The court reasoned that " [t] he true 'test of fairness' is whether the minority stockholder receives at least 'the substantial equivalent in value of what he had before.'" It next considered numerous factors that could trigger entire fairness and cited several cases where Delaware courts applied entire fairness to transactions not involving "a specific amount of cash per share." The court stated that " [t] aken to its logical extreme, the defendants' argument would mean that a court could not apply entire fairness in a stock-for-stock merger, because there is no dollars-and-cents price." Finally, the court concluded that the Conversions in this case operate like stock-for-stock mergers and that the court could conduct an entire fairness inquiry and consider "whether stockholders received the substantial equivalent of what they had before."

## d. The Court of Chancery Held That Plaintiffs Pled Sufficient Facts to Question Whether Entire Fairness May Apply

The court held that Plaintiffs had pled sufficient facts to make it reasonably conceivable that the Conversions were not entirely fair and, thus, Defendants have the burden of demonstrating entire fairness. On the fair price prong, the court found that Plaintiffs had pled sufficient facts showing that stockholders will not "receive the substantial equivalent of what they had before." . . .

# e. The Court of Chancery Forused on Stockholders' "Litigation Rights" 

The court described three types of stockholder's rights: economic rights, governance rights, and litigation rights. The court discussed how curtailing economic or governance rights would trigger entire fairness and reasoned that " [t] he same should be true for litigation rights." It noted that access to courts is necessary to protect the other rights and that "[w]ithout legal protection, an investor's capital becomes a gift." The court then held that "[f]rom the perspective of equity, Delaware law should be just as concerned about transactions that reduce stockholders' litigation rights as it is about transactions that reduce their economic rights or governance rights." Finally, the court concluded that " [t] his decision treats litigation rights as first-class rights."

## f. The Court of Chancery Denied Injunctive Relief

The court rejected Defendants' argument that a Delaware court could never enjoin an entity from leaving the state since the court has the power to prevent persons and assets from leaving its jurisdiction when necessary to preserve its ability to award final relief. However, the court found that such circumstances were not present because money damages would be an adequate remedy and, therefore, Plaintiffs failed to make the showing necessary for injunctive relief. . . .

## 5. This Court Granted Interlocutory Appeal

In April 2024, this Court accepted an interlocutory appeal of the Court of Chancery's decision. We concluded that the application met the standards for review under Rule 42(b). We supported this decision stating that:

Certainty regarding the standard of review applicable to a decision to reincorporate in another jurisdiction would be beneficial, the Interlocutory Opinion involves a question of law regarding reincorporation in another jurisdiction that was decided for the first time in this state, interlocutory review may terminate the litigation, and the likely benefits of interlocutory review outweigh the probable costs.

Oral argument was held before this Court on October 30, 2024. . . .

## III. Contentions on APPEAL...

The State of Nevada filed an amicus brief generally supporting Defendants' position. Nevada argues that the Conversions do not confer a non-ratable benefit that would trigger entire fairness. Nevada argues that the Court of Chancery's opinion "violates principles of comity by calling for Delaware courts to quantify the supposed 'harm' that a move from Delaware might theoretically inflict." Further, Nevada argues that "if Delaware courts engage in that analysis (and they should not), they should take judicial notice of Nevada law as it is (as permitted by Rule of Evidence 202), rather than rely upon fiery rhetoric from professors and legislators." Here, Nevada vigorously disputes the "race to the bottom" characterization of its law and argues that " [t] he description of Nevada as a 'no liability' regime, while colorful, remains academic exaggeration." Finally, Nevada argues that applying the entire fairness standard would risk creating an "exit tax" regime that would ultimately hurt Delaware. . . .

# IV. Analysis . . . 

## A. STANDARDS OF REVIEW IN CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS

There are three standards of review for corporate transactions under Delaware law: business judgment, enhanced scrutiny, and entire fairness. Here, Plaintiffs contend that entire fairness applies while Defendants contend that the business judgment rule applies.
"The [business judgment] rule creates a presumption 'that in making a business decision the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the corporation.'" "Subject to certain well defined limitations, a board enjoys the protection of the business judgment rule in discharging its responsibilities." The burden is on the party challenging the decision to establish facts rebutting the presumption. "The effect of this presumption when applied by a court is that the court will not substitute its judgment for that of the board, unless it is shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the directors' decision involved a breach of fiduciary duty." But, "[i]f the presumption of the business judgment rule is rebutted . . . the burden shifts to the director defendants to prove to the trier of fact that the challenged transaction was 'entirely fair' to the shareholder plaintiff."

We have explained how the presumption reflected in the business judgment rule operates in the context of a motion to dismiss as follows:

Procedurally, the plaintiffs have the burden to plead facts sufficient to rebut that presumption. On a motion to dismiss, the pled facts must support a reasonable inference that in making the challenged decision, the board of directors breached either its duty of loyalty or its duty of care. If the plaintiff fails to satisfy that burden, "a court will not substitute its judgment for that of the board if the . . . decision can be attributed to any rational business purpose."

In contrast to the presumption found in the business judgment rule, under entire fairness review, "'the defendants bear the burden of proving that the transaction with the controlling stockholder was entirely fair to the minority stockholders.'" In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., we described the entire fairness standard as follows:

The concept of fairness has two basic aspects: fair dealing and fair price. The former embraces questions of when the transaction was timed, how it was initiated, structured, negotiated, disclosed to the directors, and how the approvals of the directors and the stockholders were obtained. The latter aspect of fairness relates to the economic and financial considerations of the proposed merger, including all relevant factors: assets, market value, earnings, future prospects, and any other elements that affect the intrinsic or inherent value of a company's stock. However, the test for fairness is not a bifurcated one as between fair dealing and price. All aspects of the issue must be examined as a whole since the question is one of entire fairness.

These requirements make "entire fairness [ ] the highest standard of review in corporate law." Accordingly, "this Court has noted that '[b]ecause the effect of the proper invocation of the business judgment rule is so powerful and the standard of entire fairness so exacting, the determination of the appropriate standard of judicial review frequently is determinative of the outcome of [the] litigation.'"

# B. Triggers for Entire Fairness Review 

This Court has noted that " [t] he entire fairness standard applies only if the presumption of the business judgment rule is defeated." In the director context, "in order to rebut the business judgment rule presumption, an interest must be subjectively material to the director. In other words, the alleged benefit must be significant enough as to make it improbable that the director could perform his fiduciary duties to the shareholders." "Classic examples of director self-interest in a business transaction involve either a director appearing on both sides of a transaction or a director receiving a personal benefit from a transaction not received by the shareholders generally."
"Entire fairness is not triggered solely because a company has a controlling stockholder." "[C]ases where the controller stands on both sides of the transaction present a particularly compelling reason to apply entire fairness: both corporate decision-making bodies to which Delaware courts ardently defer - the board of directors and disinterested voting stockholders - are considered compromised by the controller's influence." Accordingly, although controlling stockholders are at times free to act in their own self-interest, "a controlling stockholder is a fiduciary and must be fair to the corporation and its minority stockholders when it stands on both sides of a transaction and receives a non-ratable benefit." "Transactions where the controller is on only one side of the transaction also face entire fairness scrutiny to assuage the risk that a controller who stands to earn 'different consideration or some unique benefit' will flex his control to secure that self-interested deal to the detriment of minority stockholders." As we [have] noted . . "[e]ntire fairness is the standard of review in transactions between a controlled corporation and a controlling stockholder when the controlling stockholder receives a non-ratable benefit." Accordingly, "where a controlling stockholder transacts with the controlled corporation and receives a non-ratable benefit, the presumptive standard of review is entire fairness."

Here, Defendants include both a controller-Maffei-and several directors. Therefore, we analyze whether entire fairness review applies to either or both sets of defendants. Entire fairness may apply if Defendants receive a non-ratable benefit from the Conversions. We conclude that, based on the pleaded allegations, Defendants will not receive a non-ratable benefit from the Conversions and, accordingly, the entire fairness standard of review does not apply.
# C. DEFINING A NON-RATABLE BENEFIT 

We begin by defining what a non-ratable benefit is. In the director context, "a director is considered interested when he or she will receive a personal financial benefit from a transaction that is not equally shared by the stockholders." "The benefit received by the director and not shared with stockholders must be of a sufficiently material importance, in the context of the director's economic circumstances, as to have made it improbable that the director could perform her fiduciary duties . . . without being influenced by her overriding personal interest."

In the controller context, "the plaintiffs must plead that [the controller] had a conflicting interest in the Merger in the sense that he derived a personal financial benefit to the exclusion of, and detriment to, the minority stockholders." "A nonratable benefit exists when the controller receives a unique benefit by extracting something uniquely valuable to the controller, even if the controller nominally receives the same consideration as all other stockholders."
"Delaware decisions have applied the entire fairness framework to compensation arrangements, consulting agreements, services agreements, and similar transactions between a controller or its affiliate and the controlled entity." However, the mere fact that a controller may be better positioned after a transaction does not necessarily mean that the controller received a non-ratable benefit. In Williams v. Geier, ^175 "we affirmed the Court of Chancery's business judgment review of a recapitalization that involved a charter amendment that provided for a form of tenure voting." In Williams, "charter amendments implement[ed] tenure voting[ ]" and "the controlling stockholders reap[ed] a benefit from the transaction." "But the Williams majority also concluded that 'no non-pro rata [sic] or disproportionate benefit . . . accrued to the [controlling stockholders] on the face of the Recapitalization, although the dynamics of how the Plan would work in practice had the effect of strengthening the [controlling stockholders'] control.'" In Match, we distinguished Williams observing that in Williams, "[e]ntire fairness review did not apply because the controlling stockholders received the same benefit as other stockholders."

## 1. A Non-Ratable Benefit Must Be Material to Trigger Entire Fairness in This Context

The concern over controller and director self-interest animates the entire fairness standard, and the cases suggest that a non-ratable benefit must be material to trigger entire fairness review. As the Court of Chancery noted, "[a] fiduciary is interested in a transaction when it confers a material benefit on the fiduciary."

We agree with the Vice Chancellor that a materiality requirement is appropriate in the context of this case where the principal focus has been on the alleged non-ratable benefits potentially flowing to the controller. Further, such a requirement achieves continuity with our law in the director context where we have more explicitly stated that non-ratable benefits and financial interests must be sufficiently material in order to taint director interest.
# 2. Temporality of Litigation Is a Key Factor in Determining Materiality 

The Court of Chancery rejected the idea that Delaware precedent has a temporal distinction that distinguishes between cases based on existing versus future potential liability. The court read precedent as supporting a materiality requirement as opposed to a temporal distinction. We do not view these concepts as mutually exclusive. Rather, our reading of Delaware precedent persuades us that temporality is a key factor because it weighs heavily in determining materiality in this context.

We recognize that providing protection to directors against future liability exposure does not automatically convey a non-ratable benefit. Were this the case, no board could use company funds to . . . adopt a Section 102(b) (7) exculpation provision without triggering entire fairness review. Yet Delaware courts have declined to find that directors lack independence or disinterestedness because they adopted a Section 102(b) (7) provision, even though such provisions reduce a director's future liability exposure. Our courts have also held that the receipt of indemnification benefits does not necessarily taint a director's judgment with self-interest. Finally, boards almost universally procure D\&O policies, which reduce the risk of director liability exposure in future litigation.

Based upon our review of the precedent, as further explained below, we conclude that temporality weighs heavily in determining materiality here and, ultimately, whether a non-ratable benefit exists that triggers entire fairness review. We hold that the absence of any allegations that any particular litigation claims will be impaired or that any particular transaction will be consummated post-conversion, weighs heavily against finding that the alleged reduction in liability exposure under Nevada's corporate law regime is material. . . .

Case law also demonstrates that courts draw a distinction between limitations of directors' liability exposure for past acts and future acts. This distinction can be seen by comparing cases where directors adopted provisions under Section 102(b) (7) —which, by their terms, cannot limit directors' liability for past conduct-with cases where directors acted to extinguish existing potential liability for past conduct. . . .

## 3. Courts Apply Temporal Distinctions Regarding Speculative Liability in Other Areas and Courts Can Do So When Reviewing Corporate Transactions

We respectfully disagree with the Court of Chancery that such a temporal distinction is "arbitrary" and "hard to follow." Courts routinely apply temporal distinctions to require litigants to do more than speculate. Defendants correctly argue that courts readily draw these distinctions in other circumstances, and they cite requirements for standing under the United States and Delaware Constitutions, as well as the federal and Delaware Declaratory Judgment Acts as examples. We agree with Defendants' position.

For example, our ripeness jurisprudence shows that Delaware courts regularly require more than speculation about future litigation for a party to litigate a claim. . . .

This Court's standing jurisprudence further shows our reluctance to decide cases involving speculative litigation. In Employers Insurance Co. of Wausau v. First State Orthopaedics, P.A., . . . we rejected standing based on speculation noting that standing requires "[a]n actual or imminent injury" that is "neither hypothetical nor conjectural." . . . Thus, we find that a temporal distinction is consistent with how courts evaluate litigation rights and that it is neither "arbitrary," nor "hard to follow."

Here, Plaintiffs' allegations have not satisfied the requirement of pleading a material benefit because they have not alleged anything more than speculation about what potential liabilities Defendants may face in the future. On this record, we cannot conclude that the Conversions would provide Defendants with a material, non-ratable benefit triggering entire fairness review. Accordingly, we hold that the business judgment rule is the applicable standard of review in this case.

# D. COMITY CONSIDERATIONS REINFORCE OUR CONCLUSION 

We note finally that, although comity concerns are not an independent ground for reversal in this case, our holding furthers the goals of comity by our declining to engage in a cost-benefit analysis of the Delaware and Nevada corporate governance regimes. "The United States is a federal republic that depends on comity among the states for the peaceful and efficient conduct . . . of private commerce.'" States have taken different approaches on matters such as the scope of director and officer exculpation, standards of review, and the scope of stockholder inspection rights. And litigation rights, as the Vice Chancellor recognized, are only one stick in the corporate governance bundle. Delaware courts are well-aware that "it is more than the statutory words on paper that give life to a system of entity law. Much often depends on the extent to which specific disputes are consistently handled by courts, thus giving business [persons] predictable guidance by which to order their relations."

The record shows that Defendants considered a number of factors in their weighing of the costs and benefits of the Conversions. These factors included the respective court systems, the predictability of the courts with respect to corporate matters, the judges' expertise in handling such disputes, the development and body of judicial decisions, and the familiarity of market participants with the corporate governance regime.

If one were to determine "whether stockholders received the substantial equivalent of what they had before[ ]", it would make sense that the companies would consider the value of what the stockholders had regarding the overall integrated corporate governance structure. In addition to the court system, the judges, the state of the development of the case law, and the familiarity of market participants with the regime, such an analysis could also include the process by which corporate statutory amendments are proposed and adopted by the state legislatures, the effectiveness of the state's Secretary of State office in facilitating corporate filings, and the existence of a corporate Bar available, willing, and able to handle such disputes.

If one focuses more broadly on the corporate governance regime beyond just litigation rights alone, then it becomes even more apparent that courts are illequipped to quantify the costs and benefits of one state's corporate governance regime over another's. Under the facts presented here, we should be cautious about secondguessing the judgments of the directors as to how best evaluate and weigh the various competing considerations as such factors might apply to a specific corporation. This is particularly true given that none of these features is static, including the statutory schemes at issue and their related case law developments. We submit that attempting to value competing corporate governance structures, particularly in the absence of any concrete allegations of Defendants receiving a material, non-ratable benefit, and based upon hypothetical future transactions, as here, would be an unacceptably speculative cost-benefit exercise. Such an exercise, under these circumstances, also risks intruding on the value judgments of state legislators and directors of corporations.

# E. OUR CONCLUSION ALIGNS WITH DELAWARE POLICY 

Delaware policy has long recognized the values of flexibility and private ordering. Allowing directors flexibility in determining an entity's state of incorporation is consistent with this Delaware policy. Declining to second-guess directors' decisions to redomesticate where there are no well-pled allegations of a material, non-ratable benefit flowing to the directors or controllers furthers this important policy.

## V. Conclusion

For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the business judgment rule applies to the present case. Accordingly, we REVERSE the judgment below.

## NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1. Take a look at §78.138 of the Nevada Corporations Code. Do you share plaintiff's concerns about the risk that reincorporation poses to their interests as minority shareholders?
2. The Court of Chancery opinion in Maffei suggested that its holding was not solely aimed at jurisdictional changes; indeed, if a Delaware corporation sought to become a Delaware LLC, that decision could be subject to entire fairness review if challenged. The Court of Chancery opinion therefore left open the question as to whether other governance changes would also subject a controlled company to entire fairness review. Suppose, for example, Elon Musk sought to amend Tesla's bylaws to adopt a forum-selection clause specifying that Texas would be the exclusive forum for future shareholder litigation involving the company, which is permitted under Delaware G.C.L. § 115. Given the Supreme Court opinion in Maffei, could shareholders seek judicial review of that decision (and potential damages) under the entire fairness standard of review?
3. Recall our discussion of state competition for corporate charters in Chapter 3. Is providing shareholders the ability to challenge a proposed reincorporation consistent with a race to the bottom or race to the top narrative?
4. The opinion in Tornetla expressed the Delaware Court of Chancery's expansive role in reviewing the conduct of controllers. Critics argued that this strict scrutiny threatens Delaware corporations with increased costs of meritless litigation; proponents contended that careful review of controller transactions is necessary to protect minority shareholders and encourage them to invest. If you were a minority shareholder of a controlled company, would you welcome these doctrinal protections? If not, why? If you were a founder of company that planned to go public with a dualclass voting structure that would maintain your control, would you avoid Delaware? What risks might you expose your company to by incorporating elsewhere?
