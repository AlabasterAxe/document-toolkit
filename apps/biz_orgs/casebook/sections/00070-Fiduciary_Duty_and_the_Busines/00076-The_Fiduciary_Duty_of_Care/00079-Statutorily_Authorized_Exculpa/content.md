MBCA § 2.02(b)(4)
Delaware G.C.L. § 102(b)(7)
Potential purchasers of corporate stock will be more likely to invest if they can be assured that directors will be reasonably diligent, skillful, and loyal in carrying out their duties. Rigorous judicial enforcement of directors' duty of care and loyalty may provide such assurance, but as the previous section highlights, the cost to investors in curtailed entrepreneurial risk-taking could be substantial. As illustrated earlier in this chapter, the business judgment rule lessens the risk of unnecessary judicial interference with, or second-guessing of, directors' judgments. However, the decision in Smith v. Van Gorkom made it clear that directors could incur substantial liability even when acting loyally. Directors lacking protection against such risks arguably could be expected to respond in either of two ways: (1) become overly cautious in carrying out their duties or (2) refuse to serve at all. Neither response would be in the shareholders' best interest, particularly if, as a result, corporations were unable to attract qualified "outside" directors.

Beginning with Delaware in 1986, most states have now enacted legislation allowing corporations to limit or eliminate directors' liability for breach of fiduciary duty.
The following case illustrates how an exculpation clause works to lessen directors' exposure to the threat posed by the decision in Smith v. Van Gorkom.

# Malpiede v. Townson <br> Supreme Court of Delaware, 2001 (en banc) 780 A.2d 1075 

Veasey, Chief Justice.
In this appeal, we affirm the holding of the Court of Chancery. . . granting. . . a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' due care claim on the ground that the exculpatory provision in the charter of the target corporation authorized by 8 Del. C. § 102(b) (7), bars any claim for money damages against the director defendants based solely on the board's alleged breach of its duty of care. . . .

## FACTS

Frederick's of Hollywood ("Frederick's") is a retailer of women's lingerie and apparel with its headquarters in Los Angeles, California. This case centers on the merger of Frederick's into Knightsbridge Capital Corporation ("Knightsbridge") under circumstances where it became a target in a bidding contest. . . .

## The Due Care Claim

Having concluded that the complaint was properly dismissed under Chancery Rule 12(b) (6) for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted on other fiduciary duty claims, we now turn to the due care claim. The primary due care issue is whether the [Frederick's] board was grossly negligent, and therefore breached its duty of due care, in failing to implement a routine defensive strategy that could enable the board to negotiate for a higher bid or otherwise create a tactical advantage to enhance stockholder value [before accepting the final Knightsbridge offer].

In this case, that routine strategy would have been for the directors to use a poison pill to ward off Knightsbridge's advances and thus to prevent Knightsbridge from stopping the auction process. Had they done so, plaintiffs seem to allege that the directors could have preserved the appropriate options for an auction process designed to achieve the best value for the stockholders.

Construing the amended complaint most favorably to the plaintiffs, it can be read to allege that the board was grossly negligent in immediately accepting the Knightsbridge offer and agreeing to various restrictions on further negotiations without first determining whether Veritas would issue a counteroffer. . . .

We assume, therefore, without deciding, that a claim for relief based on gross negligence during the board's auction process is stated by the inferences most favorable to plaintiffs that flow from these allegations. The issue then becomes whether the amended complaint may be dismissed upon a Rule 12(b) (6) motion by reason of the existence and the legal effect of the exculpatory provision of Article TWELFTH of Frederick's certificate of incorporation, adopted pursuant to 8 Del. C. § 102(b) (7). That provision would exempt directors from personal liability in damages with certain exceptions (e.g., breach of the duty of loyalty) that are not applicable here. ^45. . .

# APPLICATION OF EMERALD PARTNERS 

We now address plaintiffs' argument that the trial court committed error, based on certain language in Emerald Partners, ^57 by barring their due care claims. Plaintiffs' arguments on this point are based on an erroneous premise, and our decision here is not inconsistent with Emerald Partners.

In Emerald Partners, we made two important points about the raising of Section 102(b) (7) charter provisions. First, we said: "[T]he shield from liability provided by a certificate of incorporation provision adopted pursuant to 8 Del. C. § 102(b) (7) is in the nature of an affirmative defense. ^358 Second, we said:
[W]here the factual basis for a claim solely implicates a violation of the duty of care, this court has indicated that the protections of such a charter provision may properly be invoked and applied. . . . ^59
... It is the plaintiffs who have a burden to set forth "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." The plaintiffs are entitled to all reasonable inferences flowing from their pleadings, but if those inferences do not support a valid legal claim, the complaint should be dismissed without the need for the defendants to file an answer and without proceeding with discovery. Here we have assumed, without deciding, that the amended complaint on its face states a due care claim. Because we have determined that the complaint fails properly to invoke loyalty and bad faith claims, we are left with only a due care claim. Defendants had the obligation to raise the bar of Section 102(b) (7) as a defense, and they did. As plaintiffs conceded in oral argument before this Court, if there is only an unambiguous, residual due care claim and nothing else - as a matter of law-then Section 102(b) (7) would bar the claim. Accordingly, the Court of Chancery did not err in dismissing the plaintiffs' due care claim in this case. . . .

## NOTES AND QUESTIONS

1. As we saw in Smith v. Van Gorkom, directors have a duty of candor when asking shareholders to take action. Can a corporation exculpate directors for personal 46. 726 A. 2 d at 1223-24.
47. Id. at 1223 .
48. Id. at 1224 .
liability for breach of the duty of candor? In Delaware, the answer depends on whether the candor violation occurs as a result of a good-faith action which nonetheless breaches the duty of care or, instead, arises either from bad faith or otherwise disloyal conduct.


#### Abstract

[T]he VLI directors are shielded from liability by Delaware G.C.L. § 102(b)(7) and the amendment to VLI's Certificate of Incorporation giving effect to that statutory provision. The record reveals that any misstatements or omissions that occurred were made in good faith. The VLI directors lacked any pecuniary motive to mislead the VLI stockholders intentionally and no other plausible motive for deceiving the stockholders has been advanced. A good faith erroneous judgment as to the proper scope or content of required disclosure implicates the duty of care rather than the duty of loyalty. Arnold v. Society for Savings Bancorp., Inc., 650 A.2d at 1287-1288 \& n.36. Thus, the disclosure violations at issue here fall within the ambit of the protection of section 102(b)(7).

2. When a corporation agrees to fully exculpate its directors, it is understood that the shareholders are contracting away any right they might otherwise have to hold the directors liable for damages caused solely by the directors' breach of the duty of care. However, should creditors be held to have contracted away their rights to pursue damage claims when the directors' lack of care allegedly has caused the corporation to go bankrupt? Consider the following analysis by Vice Chancellor Strine.

One of the primary purposes of §102 (b) (7) is to encourage directors to undertake risky, but potentially value-maximizing, business strategies, so long as they do so in good faith. To expose directors to liability for breach of the duty of care for derivative claims of mismanagement asserted by creditors guts this purpose by denying directors the protection of §102 (b) (7) when they arguably need it most. That is, when, despite the directors' good intentions, the business plan of the firm did not generate financial success and the firm has become insolvent, the possibility of hindsight bias about the directors' prior ability to foresee that their business plans would not pan out is at its zenith and when the exculpatory charter provision is most useful.

Furthermore, it is odd to think that creditors would be afforded greater leeway to press derivative claims than stockholders. Creditors are typically better positioned than stockholders to protect themselves by the simple tool of contracting. And a body of statutory law called the law of fraudulent conveyance exists specifically to protect creditors. The reality that creditors become the residual claimants of a corporation when the equity of the corporation has no value does not justify expanding the types of claims that the corporation itself has against its directors. It simply justifies enabling creditors to exercise standing to ensure that any valuable claims the corporation possesses against its directors are prosecuted.

3. A 2022 amendment to Delaware's corporation code extended the exculpation previously available to directors via charter amendments to also include various named officers (i.e., CEOs and other specified officers in the c-suite). Corporations and their boards retain the right to bring appropriate actions against officers, and stockholder derivative actions are possible if demand is met. The legal basis for officer liability is discussed in Part D.3.

[^0]: 45. Article TWELFTH provides: TWELFTH. A director of this Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its shareholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its shareholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law (iii) under Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or (iv) for any transaction for which the director derived an improper personal benefit.
